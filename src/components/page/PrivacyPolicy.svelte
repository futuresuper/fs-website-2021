  </h3>
  <h4 id="" />
  <h4 id="11-objective-and-application">
    <a name="_toc140395124" /><strong>1.1 Objective and Application</strong>
  </h4>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy (<strong>Policy</strong>) applies to Future
    Superannuation Group Pty Ltd (<strong>FSG</strong> ABN 68 618 367 927) and
    its related bodies corporate (together referred to in this document as
    <strong>Future Group</strong>, , <strong>we</strong> or
    <strong>us)</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future Group understand the importance of privacy and the security of
    personal information and is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (cth) (<strong
      >Act</strong
    >) and the Australian Privacy Principles (<strong>APP</strong>s). To ensure
    compliance with the Privacy Act and as part of our commitment to ensuring
    the security of private and confidential information, we have established
    and implemented this Policy.
  </p>
  <h4 id="12-relevant-legislation">
    <a name="_toc140395125" /><strong>1.2 Relevant Legislation</strong>
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Privacy Act applies to organisations with an annual turnover of more
    than $3 million operating in Australia and requires that we handle personal
    information in accordance with a set of national principles, known as the
    APPs. The APPs regulate the collection, use, correction, disclosure and
    transfer of personal information about individuals.
  </p>
  <p>
    APP 1 requires organisations to manage personal information in an open and
    transparent way and to have a clearly expressed and up to date privacy
    policy about how it manages personal information. This policy must be easily
    understood and freely available and in an appropriate form, usually on its
    website. Accordingly, <strong>Attachment 1</strong> has been prepared to meet
    these obligations and will be made available on the website of all companies
    within the Future Group.
  </p>
  <p>
    The General Data Protection Regulations (<strong>GDPR</strong>) in the
    European Union and the United Kingdom impose similar obligations to
    organisations operating in those regions to ensure personal information is
    used fairly, lawfully and transparently. While we have taken steps to align
    with GDPR we do not comply with these regimes as we do not operate in those
    regions.
  </p>
  <h4 id="13-awareness-and-understanding">
    <a name="_toc140395126" /><strong>1.3 Awareness and understanding</strong>
  </h4>
  <p>
    A copy of this Policy is made available to all staff of Future Group on a
    shared drive. If material changes are made to this Policy, these changes are
    communicated to all staff by the most appropriate means in the given
    circumstances, and a copy of the revised document is made available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Training is provided to staff to ensure they are aware of their
    responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Persistent and conscious failure by staff members to act in accordance with
    this Policy is considered a serious disciplinary matter and corrective
    action will be determined by Future Group on a case-by-case basis.
  </p>
  <h4 id="15-review"><a name="_toc140395127" /><strong>1.5 Review</strong></h4>
  <p>
    This Policy is reviewed at least every two years. An ad hoc review of this
    Policy may be triggered outside of the regular review timetable if:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      If there is a significant change to the size, business mix, or complexity
      of business operations;
    </li>
    <li>
      If there is a significant change in relevant legislation, regulatory
      requirements or prudential standards and guidance; or
    </li>
    <li>At any other time on the request of the FSG Board.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The findings of any review, and the action taken and/or planned to address
    issues identified in the review process, will be reported to the FSG Board.
  </p>
  <h3 id="2-data-breaches">
    <a name="_toc140395128" /><strong>2. Data breaches</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Despite best endeavours data breaches with respect to personal information
    may occur from time to time. A data breach occurs when personal information
    an organisation holds is lost or subject to unauthorised access or
    disclosure. For example, when:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A device with a customer’s personal information is lost or stolen</li>
    <li>A database with personal information is hacked</li>
    <li>Personal information is mistakenly given to the wrong person.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="21-reporting-data-breaches---internal">
    <a name="_toc140395129" /><strong
      >2.1 Reporting data breaches - internal</strong
    >
  </h4>
  <p>
    All privacy breaches should be reported to the Future Group nominated
    Privacy Officer in accordance with the Incident and Breach Management Policy
    as soon as possible and ideally within 1 business day to allow for
    assessment and management of the breach.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Privacy Officer must take reasonable steps to complete a Notifiable Data
    Breach (<strong>NDB</strong>) assessment within 30 calendar days after the
    day we became aware of the breach or had reason to suspect an eligible data
    breach has occurred.
  </p>
  <h4 id="22-reporting-data-breaches--external">
    <a name="_toc140395130" /><strong
      >2.2 Reporting data breaches – external</strong
    >
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Privacy Act requires organisations to notify the Office of the
    Australian Information Commissioner (<strong>OAIC</strong>) when a privacy
    breach is assessed under the NDB scheme as being an ‘eligible data breach’.
    An eligible data breach occurs when:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      There is unauthorised access to or disclosure of personal information, or
      a loss of personal information, that an organisation holds
    </li>
    <li>
      This is likely to result in serious harm to one or more individuals, and
    </li>
    <li>
      The organisation hasn’t been able to prevent the likely risk of serious
      harm through remedial action.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Whether a data breach is likely to result in serious harm requires an
    objective assessment, determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person
    within the Future Group. This assessment will be undertaken by the Privacy
    Officer using the checklist in <strong>Attachment 2</strong>. In general,
    entities are not expected to make external enquiries about the circumstances
    of each individual whose information is involved in the breach.

    directly from you. This might be when you contact us by telephone, email,
    letter or online in order to complete a product or service application, or
    any other kind of administrative form. Our emails may contain automatic
    features that collect personal information. You can engage with us through
    social media or our website, or through our mobile phone app.

  </p>
  <p>
    If you ask us we will take reasonable steps to let you know how we have

    or service, or as soon as practicable. Consent can be either express or
    implied. Where consent is requested, we will properly inform you what you
    are consenting to.

    we will stop sending such information within a reasonable amount of time.

  <h4 id="38-how-do-we-deal-with-unsolicited-information">
    <strong>3.8 How do we deal with unsolicited information?</strong>

    Where we receive information that we have not requested (“unsolicited
    information”), we will determine whether we could have legally collected the
    information, and whether it is reasonably necessary for our functions or
    activities. If it is, we will handle the information in the same way that we
    handle information we have requested. If not, we will take steps to destroy
    or de-identify the information.

      >Attachment 2 – Eligible Data Breach Assessment Checklist</strong
    >
  </h3>
  <p>
    Use this checklist to assess whether a privacy breach meets the threshold to
    be considered a Notifiable Data Breach (<strong>NDB</strong>), also known as
    an Eligible Data Breach, in accordance with part IIIC of the Act. See
    AUSTRAC guidance here:
    <a
      href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/data-breach-preparation-and-response/part-4-notifiable-data-breach-ndb-scheme#identifying-eligible-data-breaches"
      >https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/data-breach-preparation-and-response/part-4-notifiable-data-breach-ndb-scheme#identifying-eligible-data-breaches</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>An NDB occurs when:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      There is unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of personal
      information, or a loss of personal information, that an entity holds, and
    </li>
    <li>
      This is likely to result in serious harm to one or more individuals, and
    </li>
    <li>
      The entity has been unable to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with
      remedial action
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Serious harm is not defined in the Privacy Act. In the context of a data
    breach, serious harm to an individual may include serious physical,
    psychological, emotional, financial, or reputational harm. The risk of
    serious harm should be assessed holistically having regard to the kind of
    information, the sensitivity of the information, whether the information is
    protected by security measures, the person/s who have or could obtain the
    information, and other relevant matters with respect to the data breach.
  </p>
  <p>
    EDB assessment is undertaken by the Privacy Officer to determine whether <em
      >a reasonable person would believe there might be risk of serious harm to
      an individual</em
    > whose personal information was part of the data breach.

    <strong>The type of personal information</strong>
  </h4>
  <p>
    Some kinds of personal information may be more likely to cause an individual
    serious harm if compromised. Examples of the kinds of information that may
    increase the risk of serious harm if there is a data breach include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      ‘sensitive information’, (guidance can be found at <a
        href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/data-breach-preparation-and-response/part-4-notifiable-data-breach-ndb-scheme#ftn24"
        >**[24]</a
      ><strong>)</strong> such as information about an individual’s health
    </li>
    <li>
      documents commonly used for identity fraud (including Medicare card,
      driver licence, and passport details)
    </li>
    <li>financial information</li>
    <li>
      a combination of types of personal information (rather than a single piece
      of personal information) that allows more to be known about the
      individuals the information is about.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="the-circumstances-of-the-breach">
    <strong>The circumstances of the breach</strong>
  </h4>
  <p>
    The specific circumstances of the data breach are relevant when assessing
    whether there is a risk of serious harm to an individual. This may include
    consideration of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Whose personal information was involved in the breach?</strong> An
      entity could consider whose personal information was involved in the breach,
      as certain people may be at particular risk of serious harm. A data breach
      involving the names and addresses of individuals might not, in various circumstances,
      be likely to result in serious harm to an individual, particularly if that
      information is already publicly available. However, if the entity knows that
      the information involved primarily relates to individuals known to be vulnerable,
      this may increase the risk of serious harm.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>How many individuals were involved?</strong> If the breach involves
      the personal information of many individuals, the scale of the breach should
      affect an entity’s assessment of likely risks. Even if an entity considers
      that each individual will only have a small chance of suffering serious harm,
      if more people’s personal information is involved in the breach, it may be
      more likely that at least some of the individuals will experience serious harm.
      From a risk perspective, it may be prudent, depending on the particular circumstances,
      to assume a breach involving the personal information of a very large number
      of people is likely to result in serious harm to at least one of those individuals,
      unless context or circumstances would support this not being the case.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >Do the circumstances of the data breach affect the sensitivity of the
        personal information?</strong
      >
      A breach that may publicly associate an individual’s personal information with
      a sensitive product or service they have used may increase the risk of serious
      harm. For example, a data breach involving an individual’s name may involve
      a risk of serious harm if the entity’s name links the individual with a particular
      form of physical or mental health care. (Guidance can be found at
      <a
        href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/data-breach-preparation-and-response/part-4-notifiable-data-breach-ndb-scheme#ftn26"
        ><strong>[26]</strong></a
      >).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>How long has the information been accessible?</strong> The time between
      when the data breach occurred and when the entity discovers the breach will
      be relevant to the entity’s consideration of whether serious harm is likely
      to occur. For example, if personal information is publicly accessible for a
      significant period before the entity is aware of the data breach, it may be
      more likely that the personal information have been accessed in ways that will
      result in serious harm to the individuals affected.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >Is the personal information adequately encrypted, anonymised, or
        otherwise not easily accessible?</strong
      > A relevant consideration is whether the information is rendered unreadable
      through the use of security measures to protect the stored information, or
      if it is stored in such a way so that it cannot be used if breached. In considering
      whether security measures (such as encryption) applied to compromised data
      are adequate, the entity should consider whether the method of encryption is
      an industry-recognised secure standard at the time the entity is assessing
      the likelihood of risk. Additionally, an entity should have regard to whether
      the unauthorised recipients of the personal information would have the capability
      to circumvent these safeguards. For example, if an attacker holds both encrypted
      data and the encryption key needed to decrypt that data, the entity should
      not assume the data is secure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >What parties have gained or may gain unauthorised access to personal
        information?</strong
      > The unauthorised disclosure of an individual’s criminal record to someone
      who knows that individual personally may increase the risk of serious reputational
      harm for that individual. In addition, where a third party that obtains unauthorised
      access to personal information or appears to target personal information of
      a particular individual or group of individuals, this may increase the risk
      of serious harm as it may be more likely the personal information is intended
      for malicious purposes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="the-nature-of-the-harm"><strong>The nature of the harm</strong></h4>
  <p>
    In assessing the risk of serious harm, entities should consider the broad
    range of potential kinds of harms that may follow a data breach. It may be
    helpful for entities assessing the likelihood of harm to consider a number
    of scenarios that would result in serious harm and the likelihood of each.
    Examples may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>identity theft</li>
    <li>significant financial loss by the individual</li>
    <li>threats to an individual’s physical safety</li>
    <li>loss of business or employment opportunities</li>
    <li>humiliation, damage to reputation or relationships</li>
    <li>workplace or social bullying or marginalisation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The likelihood of a particular harm occurring, as well as the anticipated
    consequences for individuals whose personal information is involved in the
    data breach if the harm materialises, are relevant considerations.
  </p>
  <h4 id="preventing-serious-harm"><strong>Preventing serious harm</strong></h4>
  <p>
    If an entity takes remedial action such that the data breach would not be
    likely to result in serious harm, then the breach is not an eligible data
    breach for that entity or for any other entity (see s26WF(1), s26WF(2),
    s26WF(3)).
