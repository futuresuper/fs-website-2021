      <p>
        <span class="bold"> Growth assets: </span>
        Growth assets, like shares, have the potential to increase in value significantly
        over time, but they are also subject to fluctuation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold"> Defensive assets: </span>
        More stable assets, like cash and bonds. You can earn steady interest on
        these investments with a lower chance of losing money. The tradeoff here
        is steady returns are generally lower and there’s no potential for growth
        beyond the expected returns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold"> Risk: </span>
        This is the uncertainty, or market movement, your investment is subject to.
        High Growth has been designed for individuals who are comfortable with navigating
        short-term-market volatility in pursuit of higher long-term returns, therefore
        there’s some risk involved.
