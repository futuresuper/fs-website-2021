    The only way to manage your employees' super is by clearing house. Using a
    clearing house ensures your payments are SuperStream compliant, and makes
    them easy to track.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might already have access to a clearing house through your accounting
    software. If not, the ATO's <a

    >
      Small Business Superannuation Clearing House
    </a> is free for small businesses with less than 20 employees.

  <h3>Important Information - Rejected Contributions</h3>
  <p>
    In order to accept an employer contribution, our superstream system checks
    your employees full names, date of birth, member number and TFNs with what
    we have on file.
  </p>
  <p>
    If any of your employee details do not match what we have on file for them,
    your contribution will be rejected. This is due to an update on our systems
    from 1 November. If you have previously been able to make contributions and
    are now having them rejected, please check all the aforementioned details of
    your employees are correct.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please get in touch with your employee to make sure your details with them
    are matching the details we have on file.
