A superannuation clearing house is an electronic gateway that allows you to make all your super contributions for all your employees in one single payment. Using a clearing house is a [SuperStream compliant way](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Paying-super-contributions/How-to-pay-super/SuperStream-for-employers/) to pay super contributions.

The ATOâ€™s [SuperStream certified product register](https://softwaredevelopers.ato.gov.au/SuperStream-certifiedproductregister) contains a list of commercial clearing houses available.

Alternatively, if you have 19 or fewer employees, or a turnover of less than $10 million a year, you can use the free [Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (SBSCH)](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/paying-super-contributions/how-to-pay-super/small-business-superannuation-clearing-house/).

Read more about how to access the Small Business Super Clearing House (SBSCH) Service on the ATO website: www.ato.gov.au/SBSCH
