Your employer will be able to make Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions into your super fund for as long as you remain working. Employers will be required to make super guarantee contributions to their eligible employee's super fund regardless of how much the employee is paid. Employees must still satisfy other super guarantee eligibility requirements.*

If you are between 67 - 74 years old, you can make additional voluntary contributions. But, if you are intending to claim a tax deduction on your additional voluntary contributions, you will need to satisfy the work test that is recorded in your tax return instead. 

Once you are over the age of 75, we will only be able to accept mandated Employer Super Guarantee contributions or a [Downsizer](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/what-is-the-downsizer-contribution) contribution (if eligible).
