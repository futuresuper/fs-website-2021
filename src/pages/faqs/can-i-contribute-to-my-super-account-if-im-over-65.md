Your employer will be able to make Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions into your super fund for as long as you remain working and earn more than $450 (before tax) per month.

If you are between 67 - 74 years old and wish to make additional voluntary contributions, you will need to satisfy the [**work test**](https://futuresuper.groovehq.com/help/what-is-the-work-test) or [**work test exemption**](https://futuresuper.groovehq.com/help/what-is-the-work-test-exemption).

Note - before 30 June 2020, the requirement to satisfy the work test or work test exemption applied to people 65-74. However, this maximum age limit was lifted to 67 from 1 July 2020. 

Once you are over the age of 75, we will only be able to accept mandated Employer Super Guarantee contributions made to your account.
