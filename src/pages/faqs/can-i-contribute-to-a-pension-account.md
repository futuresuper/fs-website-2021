Superannuation law prevents additional money from being added to your pension account once it has commenced.\
\
If you subsequently identify other accumulated superannuation savings with which you want to start an income stream, you can start a separate (additional) pension account in the Future Super Pension Plan. 

You will not be charged an additional set of fees on your new pension account.

To start an additional pension account, you will need a minimum starting balance of $20,000. The [minimum drawdown amount](<https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?page=9#:~:text=As%20the%20pension%20commenced%20on,a%20leap%20year)%20%3D%20%246%2C215.>) will apply to your new pension account. 

You will need to ensure that the total amount of superannuation transferred to your additional pension account does not exceed your [Transfer Balance Cap](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/withdrawing-and-using-your-super/transfer-balance-cap/).
