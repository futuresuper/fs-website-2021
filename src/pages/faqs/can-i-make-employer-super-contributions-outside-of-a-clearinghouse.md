Unfortunately, due to regulatory requirements, we can only accept employer super contributions via a clearinghouse.

We will no longer be able to accept payment received via direct deposit or BPay as these are no longer [SuperStream compliant](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/SuperStream/Employers/Are-you-paying-the-SuperStream-way-/#Chequedirecttothefund).Â **If we do receive employer contribution payments via these methods, the funds will be returned within 28 days.**

In the event that you can't make a payment to your employee through a clearinghouse, please get in touch with the ATO to find out what options are available to you.
