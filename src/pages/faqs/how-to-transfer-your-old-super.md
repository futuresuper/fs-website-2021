3. Enter the name of your other super fund in the **Name of super fund** field. This will search for your super fund. Note that some funds have multiple options. To find the correct fund, check the:

* USI (Unique Superannuation Identifier) which you can find on [the government Super Fund Lookup website](https://superfundlookup.gov.au/Tools/USI)
* ABN (Australian Business Number)

4. Enter your member number with your other fund in the **Member Number** field.
5. Select the amount to transfer. You can choose to either transfer the whole balance or transfer a specific amount (partial rollover). If you choose to transfer a specific amount, you will need to enter the amount. (A space to enter the amount will appear once the option is selected).

**Please note, if you choose to transfer your whole balance, this will automatically close your old account as well as any insurance policy or other benefits attached to it. You should consider this before making a decision to rollover.**

The rollover can take 3-7 business days to process. If successful, you will be able to see the rolled over funds within your [online account](https://my.futuresuper.com.au/).

Alternatively, you can also choose to [consolidate your super via your MyGov account and the ATO Online Services.](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/how-to-roll-over-your-existing-super-through-mygov)
