You can nominate one or more of your dependants, and/or your Legal Personal Representative, to receive the balance of your pension account as a lump sum on your death, on either a non-lapsing binding or a non-binding basis. Please see [this FAQ on how to nominate a beneficiary](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/how-do-i-nominate-a-beneficiary/).

You may also choose to nominate your spouse as a Reversionary Pension Beneficiary to continue to receive a regular payment from your pension account after you die (see the FAQ ‘What is a reversionary beneficiary?’ for more information).

Under superannuation law, your “dependants” include the following:

- Your spouse (including a de-facto spouse and a spouse of the same or opposite sex);
- Your child (including a child of a spouse who is not your biological child);
- A person in an ‘interdependent relationship’ with you; or
- Any other person who the Trustee considers was dependent on you for maintenance or support at the date of your death.

Note that the definition of a “dependant” under tax laws differs from those above. Someone can be in an interdependent relationship with you if:

- You have a close personal relationship;
- You live together;
- One or each of you provides the other with financial support; and
- One or each of you provides the other with domestic support and personal care.

Interdependency can also arise where two people have a close personal relationship but don’t live together or provide each other with financial support or personal care because of physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability (e.g. one person lives in a psychiatric institution suffering from a psychiatric disability).

If you do not nominate a beneficiary, or your nomination is invalid, the Trustee may pay the balance of your pension account to your dependants or your legal personal representative as it sees fit.
