While super is a long term investment and it’s important not to get too caught up in short term returns, it’s natural to be concerned about seeing negative returns - especially if you haven’t noticed this happening before. 



Share markets have been volatile during the first half of 2022. There are two major factors impacting markets. The first is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war has shaken markets and caused fossil fuel stocks to do well, partly due to sanctions against Russia which have restricted supply. Since Future Super doesn’t invest in fossil fuels, we haven’t benefited from those companies’ performance. 


The second factor is inflation. You may have noticed interest rates going up and concerns around cost of living. That’s driven by inflation and it impacts share markets too. Previously, we were experiencing historically low levels of inflation, this made borrowing money cheap and that in-turn impacts the companies that perform well in stock markets. Now that inflation has emerged as a concern, there's been a correction in markets.



Future Super plans for these periods where markets are volatile. You’ll see information in the Product Disclosure Statement, which outlines the goals and expectations of each investment option. The risk tolerance for Future Super products estimates at least 6 negative annual returns over any 20-year period. Those periods of negative performance are factored into our investment strategy for your super.
