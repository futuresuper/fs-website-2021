Generally, Australian employers are required by Government legislation to make superannuation contributions for all employees, regardless of how much they make each month. It doesn’t matter whether the employee is full time, part time or casual, or if they are a temporary resident of Australia.

The minimum you must pay is called the Super Guarantee (SG) and this is currently 10.5% of the employee’s wages. 

You can read more about how much super you need to pay on the ATO website [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Paying-super-contributions/How-much-super-to-pay/).
