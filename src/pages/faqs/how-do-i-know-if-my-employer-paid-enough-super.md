In the 2021-22 financial year, the super guarantee rate that your employer was obligated to pay was 10% of your annual income.

Note, effective from 1 July 2022, the super guarantee rate is now 10.5%.

You can review the total contribution amount that your employer has paid into your account on the first page of your annual member statement.
