Due to regulatory requirements, we urge all employers to pay employer super contributions via a clearinghouse as this is the most [SuperStream compliant](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/paying-super-contributions/how-to-pay-super/superstream-for-employers/) method.

In the event that you can't make a payment to your employee through a clearinghouse, you can submit an employer contribution using direct deposit and our payment confirmation form. Follow these steps:

1.  Contact us at [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au) and request our direct deposit bank details to make your employer contribution to.
2.  Fill in our [Notice of Payment form](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/employer-notice-of-payment) with the details of the contribution.
3.  Make a payment of the same amount as on the form to the account provided. Please also ensure the same payment reference is used.
