Future Super continually monitors its investment strategy taking into account changes in investment markets. No strategic changes have been made as a result of these recent negative returns and higher volatility in share markets because we believe our investment strategy will deliver the investment return objective to our members over the long term.

We continue to believe it is possible to invest in a way that has a positive impact on the world, and with ethics in mind, while also providing for our membersâ€™ retirements.
