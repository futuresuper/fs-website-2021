Whether you’ve seen your super returns go down before probably depends on how long you have had a super fund for and how often you’ve looked at your balance. 



The Australian and US share markets enjoyed a very buoyant period, where it was pretty rare for markets to be down by much, from 2009 until the pandemic in 2020. It’s actually historically rare for markets to be so consistently up, and some experts consider that period the “longest bull market in history”. Between Australian shares and US shares, that’s a decent chunk of most super funds’ balanced options. That could be why you haven’t noticed a dip in returns before. But again, it’s so important to keep that long term perspective in mind.
