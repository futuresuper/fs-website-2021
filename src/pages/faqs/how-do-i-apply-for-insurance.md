There are three ways you can apply for insurance with Future Super! 

* Easy Opt-In Standard Insurance
* Voluntary Insurance Application
* Insurance Transfer

Before applying for insurance, you may wish to review the possible premiums you may be subject to. To check what premiums may apply, you can get a quote for any of the types of coverage using our [online quote tool here](https://insurance.futuresuper.com.au/).

You may also want to [visit this page on our website](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/insurance/) for an overview of our insurance process.

**Easy Opt-In Standard Insurance**\
When you first join you have 60 days to apply for our Easy Opt-In Standard Insurance via your [Online Member Portal](https://portal.myfuturesuper.com.au/member/login_1). This option is only available for Death and Death & TPD cover. This will provide a default amount of cover based on your age and type of work subject to eligibility. 

**Voluntary Insurance Application**\
If you are an existing member whose 60 days has expired or you wish to apply for Income Protection, you can apply through our Voluntary Insurance Application. This method is more lengthy but it does allow you to pick the amount of coverage for Death and Death & TPD that best suits you. With Income Protection, you can apply for a coverage amount of up to 75% of your pre-claim salary with a maximum  benefit period of 2 years (or until age 65 if earlier). You will also need to select an appropriate waiting period. 

**I﻿nsurance Transfer**\
If you currently have insurance with an existing fund, you may be eligible to transfer this cover. To do this, you will need to fill in the transfer form and provide proof of cover that is no older than 30 days. Please note, your existing cover should be active at the time of transfer. Please contact [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au) for this form or for more information.
