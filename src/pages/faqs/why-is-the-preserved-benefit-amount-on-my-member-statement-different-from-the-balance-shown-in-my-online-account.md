The Annual Member Statement shows the balance of your account as at the 30 June of the previous financial year. This would be different to the account balance displayed currently online which would be calculated based on the latest unit price.

Your closing balance at the end of the financial year may also include some non-preserved benefit, which is dependent on your circumstances.
