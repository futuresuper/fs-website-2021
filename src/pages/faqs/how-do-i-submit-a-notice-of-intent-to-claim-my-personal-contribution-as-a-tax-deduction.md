If you wish to claim your personal contributions as a tax deduction, you need to complete a **[Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions form](http://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/n71121-11-2014_js33406_w.pdf)**. You can do this once per financial year for all the contributions during that financial year.

You can submit the form to us by email to [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au). Once your notice of intent to claim a tax deduction has been applied to your contribution, we will email you a letter of acknowledgement for the receipt of a valid notice for your tax records.

If you need to vary your notice later, you can do so provided you havenâ€™t completed your tax return for the financial year in which you have made your contributions.
