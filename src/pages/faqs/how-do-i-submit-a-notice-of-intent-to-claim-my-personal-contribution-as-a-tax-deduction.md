1. Download the [Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions form](http://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/ContAent/SPR/downloads/n71121-11-2014_js33406_w.pdf) from the ATO site. You can find further instructions about how to make a claim on the ATO website [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Claiming-deductions-for-personal-super-contributions/?page=2#How_to_make_a_claim).
2. Complete the form. The form will ask for some personal details, like your TFN, member number with Future Super, and the amount you wish to claim. A few things to note:

   * We require all our forms to be provided with a wet signature (signed with a pen on paper).
   * You are not required to provide us with your TFN if you have already done so previously. 
   * We are unable to process forms that contain duplicate signatures, crossed out sections, or sections concealed with whiteout or tape. 
3. You can submit the form to us by email to  [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au). \
   Alternatively, you can post the form to:\
   \
   Future Super\
   PO Box 1282\
   Albury NSW 2640

Once your notice of intent to claim a tax deduction has been applied to your contribution, we will email you a letter of acknowledgement for the receipt of a valid notice for your tax records.

If you need to vary your notice later, you can do so provided you havenâ€™t completed your tax return for the financial year in which you have made your contributions.
