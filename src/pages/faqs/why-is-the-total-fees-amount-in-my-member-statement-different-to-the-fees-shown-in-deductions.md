The investment fee, percentage-based administration fee and indirect cost ratios are accrued and reflected in the unit price when the unit price is calculated, and paid in arrears. These fees are not deducted directly from your account.\

The deductions listed on the first page of your member statement include the fees and costs that have been deducted directly from your account, including contributions tax and the flat dollar-based administration fee (applicableÂ  for balances over $6,000).
