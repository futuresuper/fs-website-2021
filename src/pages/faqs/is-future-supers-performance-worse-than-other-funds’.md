It depends which other fund you are looking at and over what period of time. In the first half of 2022, fossil fuel stocks have done well. The funds that invest in those stocks would have benefited from that.
 


We invest differently to other funds. Mainstream funds invest in fossil fuels and mining companies make up a significant portion of the Australian share market. To give you an idea - at the start of January 2022 Future Super screened out 65% of the ASX300. That means more than half of Australia’s top 300 companies didn’t meet our standards. For this reason, it’s not helpful to compare Future Super to a fund which invests in the entire ASX300 in the short term. It’s not apples with apples. 

Because Future Super invests so differently, there will be times when our performance looks a bit different to that of other funds. So far this year, that's meant we haven't done as well. But there have been times when we benefited from our different investment makeup. For example, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Future Super didn’t see as much of a negative impact as some other funds, because at that time resources and fossil fuels stocks were performing poorly. 

We believe that it is possible to achieve our target returns while also steering money away from fossil fuels and towards companies having a positive impact on the world.
