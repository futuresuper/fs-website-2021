### Inactive Low-Balance Accounts (ILBA)

To prevent your account from being rolled out to the ATO, you are required to make a financial change on your superannuation account. This could be one of the following:

- Making a contribution or having your employer contribute to your account,
- Amend your insurance cover,
- Making an investment option switch,
- Nominating a Binding Beneficiary to your account, or
- Combining your super accounts so your balance is $6,000 or more. You will need to do action one of the above once every 15 months to ensure that your account is not considered inactive.

**You can also provide us with a written notice electing not to be a member of an inactive low-balance account. The easiest way to do this is via our [online form](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/keep-account-open/).**

If you have any issues with the online form, you can also reach out to us via email to [info@futuresuper.com.au](mailto:info@futuresuper.com.au).

#### _Fee limit on low-balance accounts_

From 1 July 2019, Future Super will not charge the dollar based fee on accounts with balances of less than $6,000.

This is due to the new changes whereby administration and investment fees charged cannot exceed 3% of the balances of accounts with less than $6,000.

Please note that the following fees are not included in the fee cap:

- buy/sell spreads
- insurance premiums, and
- other activity fees such as investment switches (if applicable) and family law fees.

### Insurance

To prevent your insurance cover being cancelled, you are required to make a financial change on your superannuation account.

This could be one of the following:

- Making a contribution or having your employer contribute to your account
- Combine your super accounts
- Elect to maintain your insurance

#### _Making an election to keep insurance_

You can make an election to keep your insurance cover by emailing us at info@futuresuper.com.au and specifying the following information:

1. Your full name, DOB and member number (for verification purposes).
2. That you consent to maintain all your existing insurance cover in the event that your account becomes inactive for a continuous period of 16 months, notwithstanding that your account may become inactive again.

**_An election is enduring and only needs to be made once._**
