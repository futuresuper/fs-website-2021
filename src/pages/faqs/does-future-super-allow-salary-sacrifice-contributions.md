Yes. You need to organise salary sacrifice contributions directly with your employer. They will likely pay your salary sacrifice when they make your regular super guarantee contributions.

You can read more about salary sacrificing arrangements [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Growing-your-super/Adding-to-your-super/Salary-sacrificing-super/).

Please note - Salary sacrifice contributions are subject to the concessional contribution cap. If you breach this cap, you may be required to pay additional tax. For the 2022/23 financial year,  the  concessional contribution cap is $27,500 per financial year.

For more information on contribution caps, please refer to this ATO [webpage](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Super-contributions---too-much-can-mean-extra-tax/).
