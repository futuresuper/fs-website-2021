We do not accept contributions via cheque as these are not [SuperStream compliant](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Paying-super-contributions/How-to-pay-super/SuperStream-for-employers/). Please contact us if you are having difficulties making a payment on behalf of your employee.
