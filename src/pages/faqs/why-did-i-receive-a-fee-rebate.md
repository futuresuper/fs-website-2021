Under the Protecting Your Super legislation, accounts with a balance under $6,000 have a 3% fee cap. In order to comply with this legislation, the flat (dollar-based) administration fee is waived for accounts with balances under $6,000.

However, this fee cap is assessed at a particular point in time (for example, at the end of the financial year, on the 30th of June, or on your accountâ€™s date of exit). This means that, if your account balance moved over the $6,000 threshold over the course of the financial year but then fell back under the $6,000 threshold, fees may have been charged on the higher balance during the year and the 3% fee cap will have been exceeded. Therefore, a rebate was paid to your account to ensure that we did not overcharge fees.
