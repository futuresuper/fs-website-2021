We are currently implementing features allowing you to change or cancel your insurance coverage within your [online account](https://my.futuresuper.com.au/) via our website. This feature will be made available to you soon. In the meantime, please contact our member advocacy team on 1300 658 422 or info@futuresuper.com.au to change or cancel your Insurance Cover.
