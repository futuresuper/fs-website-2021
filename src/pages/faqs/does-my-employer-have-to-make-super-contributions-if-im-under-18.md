If you are under 18, you generally have to work more than 30 hours per week and earn more than $450 (before tax) per calendar month to be entitled to super contributions.

*Note: From 1 July 2022, the criteria to earn more than $450 per calendar month will be removed. Employers will be required to make super guarantee contributions to their eligible employee's super fund regardless of how much the employee is paid.* *Employees must still satisfy other super guarantee eligibility requirements. Please review the [following ATO article](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Business-bulletins-newsroom/Employer-information/Get-ready-for-super-changes-from-1-July/) for more information.*
