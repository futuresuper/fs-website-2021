The super contributions paid to your account from your income before tax are taxed at 15% and called ‘concessional’ contributions. This can include employer contributions, such as compulsory employer contributions (employer super guarantee contributions) and salary sacrifice payments made to your super fund, as well as personal contributions for which you have notified us you are intending to claim a tax deduction.
