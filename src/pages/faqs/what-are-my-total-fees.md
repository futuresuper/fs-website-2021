Your total fees include a percentage-based fee, which will differ based on which investment option you have chosen and is included as part of the unit price calculation, and a flat administration fee, that is deducted directly from your account on a monthly basis. You can find the total fees for each investment option outlined on the [Investments Options](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/investment-options/) page of our website.

 A detailed breakdown of the different fees incurred by each of our investment options is available on page 24 of our [Additional Information Booklet](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/aib). 

Please note the flat administration fee is only charged to members with account balances of over $6000.
