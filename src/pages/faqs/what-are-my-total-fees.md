Your total fees include  **percentage-based fees**, which will differ based on which investment option you have chosen and is included as part of the unit price calculation. This includes the investment fee, percentage-based administration fee and indirect cost ratios. These are referred to as ***fees and costs deducted from your investment*** in your annual member statement. These do not show in your transaction history. 

Your total fees also includes **a flat administration fee**, that is deducted directly from your account on a monthly basis. This is referred to as the ***fees deducted directly from your account*** annual member statement. 

You can find the total fees for each investment option outlined on the [Investments Options](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/investment-options/) page of our website.

A detailed breakdown of the different fees incurred by each of our investment options is available on pages 26- 30 of our [Additional Information Booklet](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/aib). 

Please note the flat rate dollar-based administration fee is only charged to members with account balances of over $6000.
