Employer Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions are presently 10.5% of a person's ordinary time earnings (subject to a maximum dollar limit). Some employers pay more than the minimum 10.5% but itâ€™s not allowable for employers to pay less than this.

You can read more about employer contributions on the government MoneySmart website [here](https://moneysmart.gov.au/grow-your-super/super-contributions).
