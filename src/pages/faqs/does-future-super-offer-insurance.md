Future Super offers opt-in insurance. You can apply for cover for the following types of insurance:

- Death Only
- Death & Total Permanent Disablement (TPD), and
- Income Protection

Death Only and Death & TPD cover helps provide you or your dependents (as applicable) with a lump sum payment in the event that you die, suffer a terminal illness, or you become totally and permanently disabled (where you have Death & TPD cover).

Income Protection cover provides you with a monthly income calculated in accordance with the relevant insurance policy (‘Monthly Benefit’) in the event that you become Partially Disabled or Totally Disabled and a Sickness or Injury causes you to be unable to work and earn an income.
