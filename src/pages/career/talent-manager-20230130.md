## About Future Super Group

At Future Super Group, we use business as a force for good - both in terms of how we run our super fund, and how we take care of our employees. We’re changing the way super is done, by giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet.

We are looking for a Talent Manager to join our purpose-led team. We exist to build a future free from climate change and inequality, and this role will be critical in helping us develop, motivate and retain the best people to help us reach this ambitious goal.

We strongly encourage applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, mature age workers, people with caring responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) people. Seriously, the problems we face are complex and the more diversity of experiences we can bring to the table, the better our solutions become.

## You’ll love this job if you:

- Find superannuation opaque and frustrating; if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would
- Like being given free reign to design processes from a blank piece of paper, or licence to throw them out and start again if they're not working
- Are always researching new ways to do things, and like to experiment and iterate processes constantly
- Get energised thinking about how to make learning and development accessible and meaningful
- Believe that employee retention is an opportunity for an organisation to demonstrate their purpose in every aspect of their business, and isn’t just about dishing up shiny benefits that no-one actually uses
- Like understanding what makes people tick, and using these insights to inform your work and approach
- Don't think it's weird that we called our latest Performance Review document "Making Performance Reviews suck less" (even better, you think it’s an appropriate title!)
- Are keen to work in a progressive, inclusive workplace that wants to do things differently

## We’re looking for someone who:

- Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy
- Is progressive, open-minded and passionate about making Future Super a place where people can do their best work
- Gets jazzed by helping people develop and progress within their roles
- Has a broad range of HR experience, with an understanding of each stage of the employee lifecycle
- Is energised by the prospect of creating and implementing a progressive learning and development program
- Is up to the challenge of defining and identifying career pathways in a small organisation, where a promotion to the next level isn’t always on offer
- Cares deeply about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and is able to consider all of their work through this lens
- Wants to drive their work, and is hungry to develop and stretch themselves within their role
- Is comfortable making recommendations and owning decisions and outcomes
- Is able to build connections with people at every level of the business
- Is a great communicator, and can change the way they convey information depending on the audience and the situation
- Isn’t above jumping in and lending a hand elsewhere in the People & Culture team if we find ourselves a bit stretched
- Brings their whole selves to work

## It would be great if you also had:

- Experience in learning and development
- Experience using data to drive decision making

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!
