## About Future Super

At Future Super, we’re making money moves and changing the way super is done. By giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet, we’re showing the power super has to change the world! 

We are looking for someone to join our mission focused high-growth startup to help us make data-driven decisions to to continue to maximise the impact that Future Super can have on the superannuation system and on climate change.

We strongly encourage applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, mature age workers, people with caring responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) people. Seriously, the problems we face are complex and the more diversity of experiences we can bring to the table, the better our solutions become.

## About the role 

* As the Strategy Manager, you’ll help drive all areas of the Strategy Team’s responsibilities, namely to get the internal strategy process humming, to guide the Corporate Strategy ship, and to become a centre of excellence in commercial insights and collateral.
* You will be reporting to and working closely with the Head of Strategy, as well as working closely with the CEO and cross-functionally with other Senior Managers and teams across the business.

## As a Strategy Manager, you will:

* Support major projects and communicate our strategy
* You will help to drive the corporate strategy and strategic direction of Future Super. This includes high-level strategic thinking on the long-term direction of the company, running capital management projects (such as capital raises and M&A) and communicating the strategy and important updates both internally and externally 
* Drive the internal strategy process

  * You will be working closely and cross-functionally across teams to set and monitor the company and functional teams’ objectives and key results. You’ll also be identifying opportunities for, and running, cross-functional projects and sprints
* Build out our commercial thinking, insights and resources

  * You will have responsibility for analysing internal data (both for reporting and ad-hoc topics) and generating & sharing insights with relevant members of the business, especially for member data. 

## You’ll love this job if:

* You find superannuation opaque and frustrating, if you had the chance to revolutionize the industry to be better for people, you would 
* You love data crunching and searching for insights to help us make decisions around our next big bets
* You are a story-teller and can synthesise information to make the complex simple
* You are a fast and relentless learner who thrives on having different problems to solve every day including how to measure our impact, identifying opportunities for organic and inorganic growth, and determining how to navigate a complex regulatory landscape

## We’re looking for someone who:

* Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy 
* Approaches their work with an open mind and can apply structure and analytical thinking to solve abstract problems
* Loves being at the nucleus of an organisation, working with all teams to execute on our strategic direction 
* Can see the big picture but cares about getting the little things right (Powerpoint & Excel ninjas are encouraged to apply)

## It would be great if you also had:

* Relevant experience designing and implementing strategy in businesses with characteristics like ours (fast growing scale-ups, or financial services, or in regulated environments, or purpose-driven etc)
* Modelling experience (not the fashion kind, the market sizing / financial kind!)

## Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, give it a good whirl!

## You'll love working here with:

* A fast-growing, purpose-driven organisation, spending your days working on making this world a better place! The more we grow, the bigger the impact we are making on climate change and inequality
* A proud B Corp organisation that cares about what how it behaves inside and out
* An outcome driven team who are focused on creating value for Future Super Group and providing opportunities for each of us to build and hone our skills, and to reach our professional goals
* Team lunches, drinks and company-wide events
* 14 weeks’ paid parental leave for all genders and a generous parental superannuation package, Employee Assistance Program (EAP), formal training and development with continuous improvement opportunities, a continuous supply of healthy office snacks (if/when you’re in the office) and membership to Bicycle NSW  (or your State’s equivalent) as part of our sustainable transport policy
* Future Super is an equal opportunity employer – we provide flexible working hours and the option to work from home / wherever you like in Australia (that has access to internet)
