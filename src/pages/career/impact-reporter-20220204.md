## About Future Super

Your super has the power to combat climate change. Future Super is a super fund that exposes the potential for people to take climate action with their super. Money is power, and at over $3.3 trillion, the super industry has the ability to create a sustainable future without waiting on politics. Future Super is proving that excluding fossil fuel investments and financing clean energy delivers competitive returns and a better future.

With ambitious targets and a passionate membership base, our Impact Reporter (first time ever we’re hiring for this role) will unearth stories about our investments and impact to our 50,000+ climate progressive members.

We strongly encourage applications from First Nations peoples, people with disability, people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, mature age workers, people with caring responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, etc. (LGBTI+) people. Seriously, the problems we face are complex and the more diversity of experiences we can bring to the table, the better our solutions become.

## You’ll love this job if:

- You have a knack and love for journalism, you know how to unearth a story or know what questions to ask to get to the juice to create an engaging story;
- Have a high level of demonstrable investment acumen. This role will largely be about discovering content in relation to an implemented investment strategy and the impact it has on our society and planet;
- You know how to take complex information and condense it into a consumer story - while still keeping it fresh and engaging;
- You have an interest or experience in telling stories about climate change, purpose driven businesses or financial investments. You’re interested in trying multiple stories out as a means to learn and test if a story is right or engaging, you’re not risk averse and you’re constantly on the hunt for the next story to tell;
- You find the superannuation industry opaque and are interested in changing how the industry communicates its investments and how that benefits members;
- You are open to talking to a diverse group of people and stakeholders to unpack and understand the facts when it comes to Future Super’s investment strategy and can translate the information into engaging content; and
- You love a fact check, you’re not afraid of a number crunch to show how our investments stack up in the wider world and their impact and you don’t mind a chat to external stakeholders when looking for an angle or commentary to bolster your story.

## We’re looking for someone who:

- Passionate about finding stories that show the power of money, inspire action, distil complex information and shine a light on our investments and how our members' money is making an impact;
- Holds a distinctive written voice that reflects what’s culturally relevant and knows how to produce stories in real-time. Can investigate our latest investments and create engaging stories to tell our members about the power of their money;
- Is ready to go undercover and immerse themselves in our investment and impact team;
- Has had journalism experience - a background in finance, business or environmental writing;
- Is proactive in sharing ideas for stories, questioning stakeholders to unearth stories. You are curious to explore all the ways to bring a story to life;
- Can produce a series of stories in a week, be their own editor, meet their own deadlines and be accountable for deciding on what to report on within our impact and investments - know what will engage our members;
- Values progress over perfection. We work quickly and we need someone who can thrive in a fast paced environment and produce content in a timely manner;
- Resilient - willing to try something new and if it doesn’t work, not afraid to keep trying new approaches;
- Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into climate solutions;
- Is keen to tell stories that drive and inspire climate action;
- Likes being upskilled - we have a training budget, team development, and safe team culture; and
- Can work across multiple teams and doesn’t get overwhelmed when you are exposed to information overload but knows how to drill down the information to a tee for a compelling piece of information.

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s ok, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over experience. So if this job resonates with you, give it a whirl.

## You'll love working here with:

- A purpose-driven organisation, spending your days working on making this world a better place! The more we grow, the bigger the impact we are making on climate change and inequality
- A proud B-Corp organisation that cares about what how it behaves inside and out
- Passionate and diverse team who driven by Future Super’s purpose and mission
- Team lunches, drinks and company-wide events
- 14 weeks’ paid parental leave for all genders and a generous parental superannuation package, Employee Assistance Program (EAP), formal training and development with continuous improvement opportunities, a continuous supply of healthy office snacks (if/when you’re in the office) and membership to Bicycle NSW  (or your State’s equivalent) as part of our sustainable transport policy
- Future Super is an equal opportunity employer – we provide flexible working hours, the option to work from home and a laptop you can use to work remotely (this used to be a more differentiating dot-point, but it’s still true!)
