## About Future Super Group

At Future Super Group, we’re making money moves and changing the way super is done. By giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet, we’re showing the power super has to change the world!

We are looking for a project management superstar to join our mission focused high-growth startup to help us drive and embed project management practices across the business. We have a bold ambition to create a prosperous future free from climate change and inequality, and this role is critical to helping us execute on the programs of work needed to make this happen.

We strongly encourage applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, mature age workers, people with caring responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) people. Seriously, the problems we face are complex and the more diversity of experiences we can bring to the table, the better our solutions become.

## You’ll love this job if:

- You find superannuation opaque and frustrating, if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would.
- You enjoy working on complex projects across all areas of a business. Future Super is a fast-growing business operating in a constantly changing industry. We have multiple projects on the go at any given time, that could include re-setting our investment approach, transitioning key services to a new service provider, or transforming the way we work to deliver on our strategy.
- You can take the 30,000 ft view to define key objectives and steer the direction of a project, but are also happy to jump in and get involved in the detail.
- You’re looking for a role that drives real impact: both for the company itself and for the world.

## We’re looking for someone who:

- Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy
- Has 3-4 years of experience in project management, and preferably some project experience in the superannuation sector or financial services more broadly.
- Is an excellent communicator with strong, multi-level stakeholder and relationship management expertise.
- Is a curious and voracious learner - Future Super is a workplace that continuously challenges the status quo, constantly striving to find new and better ways of working. We take a test and learn approach and find our trailblazing processes are a result of team members sharing an idea and taking initiative to change things up

## It would be great if you also had:

- Previous experience working on transformation or projects involving change management
- Experience in agile project management

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!
