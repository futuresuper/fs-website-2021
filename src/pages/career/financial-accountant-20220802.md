## About Future Super

At Future Super, we’re making money moves and changing the way super is done. By giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet, we’re showing the power super has to change the world! 

We are looking for someone to join our mission focused high-growth startup. You will be joining the finance team which is built on an idea-friendly organisational culture, where we strive to keep ahead of the curve. Please note, this role is a fixed 12-14 month paternity leave cover. 

We strongly encourage applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, mature age workers, people with caring responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) people. Seriously, the problems we face are complex and the more diversity of experiences we can bring to the table, the better our solutions become.

## You’ll love this job if:

* You find superannuation opaque and frustrating, if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would 
* You can be the eyes and ears of the finance team, keeping the company’s day to day financial activities in check, establishing best practice processes and partnering with the rest of the business to help us grow
* You are comfortable working with leadership and being exposed to key decisions being made 
* You keep things running like a machine and love solving complex problems
* You love to collaborate, but you also understand the importance of autonomous work
* You love getting to the bottom of any and all variances in reports

## We’re looking for someone who:

* Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy 
* Is a numbers geek and not ashamed of it. You currently are, or have a past life, working in an accounting firm or fast-moving business as a finance office, bookkeeper or accountant
* Can reconcile differences between the books and sources of truth, and take action to resolve those differences in a timely manner
* Might not have experience in all parts of this role but is hungry to jump in and learn the tools as you go

## It would be great if you also had:

* Experience with Employment Hero
* Experience with Excel and data analysis generally
* Experience with internal and/or external audits

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!

## You'll love working here with:

* A purpose-driven organisation, spending your days working on making this world a better place! The more we grow, the bigger the impact we are making on climate change and inequality
* A proud B Corp organisation that cares about how it behaves inside and out
* Heaps of flexibility to fit work into your life (not your life around our work) and the opportunity to work with your manager to define what that looks like for you now and in the future
* Team lunches, drinks and company-wide events
* 14 weeks’ paid parental leave for all genders and a generous parental superannuation package, Employee Assistance Program (EAP), formal training and development with continuous improvement opportunities, a continuous supply of healthy office snacks (if/when you’re in the office) and membership to Bicycle NSW  (or your State’s equivalent) as part of our sustainable transport policy
* Future Super is an equal opportunity employer – we provide flexible working hours, the option to work from home and a laptop you can use to work remotely (this used to be a more differentiating dot-point, but it’s still true!)

The application will require answering short questions so give yourself time to complete it. Once started, you can save and return to your application before submitting.
