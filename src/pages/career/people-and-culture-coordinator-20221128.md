## About the Future Super Group

At the Future Super Group, we use business as a force for good - both in terms of how we run our super fund, and how we take care of our employees. We’re changing the way super is done, by giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet.

## About the role

We’re looking for a People and Culture Coordinator to join our purpose-driven and fast growing team. Running a sustainable and equitable business is at the core of who we are as an organisation; our team is motivated to make Future Super the best place to work for every one of our employees. We are relentless in our pursuit of creating a delightful and seamless employee experience, where our people are engaged, valued and supported. In line with our purpose, we aim to push for initiatives, policies and practices that reduce inequality in our workplace - not a bad gig for someone who is keen to make a difference every day!

We genuinely care about our people and the planet - and we need someone who is on the same wavelength as us. You will be working with a small, collaborative and productive team who really enjoy their job and working with each other.

We strongly encourage applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, mature age workers, people with caring responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) people. Seriously, the problems we face are complex and the more diversity of experiences we can bring to the table, the better our solutions become.

## You’ll love this job if:

- You find the corporate world tiring and frustrating; if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people and the planet, you would
- You thrive in a fast-moving and fluid environment where no two days are the same. You’re a chameleon - not only do you adapt to change but you find change exciting
- You don’t get tired of being called a “people person” because that’s who you are. You get a kick out of interacting with different people on a day-to-day basis
- You’re comfortable in highly ambiguous situations and get a thrill out of finding scalable solutions and processes that will improve on how we operate
- You’re constantly curious. You may have a lot, a little or no experience in the people and culture space but in any case, you love learning and challenging yourself. You are always seeking feedback and finding ways to develop into your role
- You love brainstorming ideas and problem solving. You’re not shy to make recommendations and you’re always on the lookout for ways in which we can improve
- You are a diversity and inclusion champion. You uphold the principles of diversity and inclusion in every aspect of your work
- You care about making the world a better place! You want to use your skills and your time to drive climate action and equality

## We’re looking for someone who:

- Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy
- Has awesome written and verbal communication skills. They find corporate jargon boring and they’re keen to adapt a tone of voice that our team and potential employees will vibe with
- Is people-centric through and through. They understand the importance of demonstrating sensitivity and confidentiality to ensure that our team is seen as trusted and valued within our organisation. They are warm and engaging and has the special sauce to make anyone feel comfortable
- Is super-organised and can juggle lots of different tasks (both big and small) at the same time. Prioritising and re-prioritising is their jam, this is a must as additional work always trickles in
- Takes pride in everything they do - they don’t do things half-baked but they recognise when they’ve devoted enough time to something and don’t get hung up on tweaking work to get it absolutely perfect, at the expense of getting through the rest of their to-do list. They put time and effort into their work but value progress over perfection
- Has a sense of humour! Bringing our whole selves to work is integral to the team. We want to work with someone who likes to collaborate in an open, trusting and fun environment
- Strikes the balance of working individually and autonomously with working with and alongside other people. They should be comfortable being part of a team or driving end-to-end projects - whatever the job calls for, really!
- Is Confident and open-minded. They might not know the answers, they might not know how to do something, but they have the confidence and initiative to find the answers, try different solutions and reach out for support when needed
- Is progressive, open-minded and passionate about making Future Super the best place to work for everyone

## As the People and Culture Coordinator you will:

- Drive the end-to-end recruitment, onboarding and offboarding processes. Once you find your feet, you will provide recommendations on how we can improve the recruitment, onboarding and offboarding experience
- Run the check-ins with new starters and conduct exit interviews. You will collect feedback, find recurring themes and make suggestions as to what feedback we should action
- Maintain employee records, generate contracts and other HR-related paperwork as needed
- Support our performance review process
- Assist with our remuneration review process
- Administer our quarterly engagement surveys
- Manage birthday and work anniversary announcements and make sure no one’s special celebration is missed
- Be the first point of contact for leave and pay-related questions as well as any queries from new starters and any interested people who want to work with us
- Assist with payroll
- Maintain all our people-related policies and processes
- Ensure Workplace Health and Safety considerations and compliance needs are met
- Plan fun virtual and in-real-life social activities for the team
- Provide updates to the broader team about all things people and HR
- Assist with office administration/business operations tasks
- Work closely with the People and Culture Advisor
- Other project-related work as required. This can vary a lot depending on our team’s goals. If you have been working with us over the past few months, you would have been involved in drafting our submission for AFR’s Best Place to Work 2022 and sourcing travel policies and best practices

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!
