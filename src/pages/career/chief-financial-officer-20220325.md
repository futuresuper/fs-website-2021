## About Future Super

At Future Super, we want to build a future free from climate change and inequality. By changing the way super is done and giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet, we’re proving to our industry that doing good can affect meaningful change in so many ways.

We strongly encourage applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, mature age workers, people with caring responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) people. Seriously. The problems we face are complex and the more diversity of experiences we can bring to the table, the better our solutions become.

## About the role

We are looking for someone to join our mission focused, high-growth startup as Chief Financial Officer, helping to take our business to the next level of growth. Future Super currently manages around $10b in funds under management. We need a CFO who is going to help us become a $50b+ superannuation fund. This is a massive opportunity for anyone who is up for a challenge. You will be responsible for overseeing all of Future Super’s financial activities including external audit, FP&A, fundraising, serving as a strategic advisor to the CEO, COO, Board and leadership team, while supporting, building, and managing the Finance Team to do their best work.

The Chief Financial Officer reports into the Chief Operating Officer.

## You’ll love this job if:

* You see the massive potential of superannuation as an agent of change in Australia - you can see the power of capital in making change in the world and want to work for a company obsessed with creating that change 
* You’re able to tell a story with numbers without jargon - you possess the ability to provide a financial narrative across the business and identify the key drivers with a view to be able to allocate resources across these teams. You can paint a picture to a wide-range of stakeholders who do not have a CA/CPA 
* You’re a natural mentor - and strong communicator who is able to coach the CEO, Board and other senior stakeholders across the Future Super Group, help them understand the nuances of the business and present information to relevant stakeholders when required. You are energised by helping people understand the financial impacts of decisions and finding solutions to hard questions beyond an NPV analysis 
* You’re a delivery expert - you have proven experience in delivering financial goals. You’re not afraid to get on the tools from time-to-time while maintaining a focus on the strategic drivers of the business 
* You’re able to help investors see Future Super’s value - you are confident in a regulated environment and can partner with the CEO in future fundraising rounds. You’re comfortable playing a support role in fundraising, while also ready to answer any and all investor questions on the finances 
* You think more than you should about how budgets interact with strategy  - you understand that traditional top-down budgeting doesn’t work in a fast-moving environment, but you can see the value in planning for the future. You live in the grey area between constantly changing plans and the need for long-term projections. You have proven experience with forecast based planning - you’re a logical, structured thinker who is confident in hypothesis testing and problem solving
* You love both management and financial reporting - you are confident in reporting to a variety of stakeholders (investors, Board, auditors, regulators, etc.) and developing business proposals based on data
* You see technology as an opportunity to revolutionise financial reporting - you are ready to test and learn how we use financial data and technology to further Future Super’s strategy across the business. You borrow ways of working from any industry that delivers innovation and growth
* You want to create a team where everyone does their best work - you are thoughtful and people-focused with how you build and manage a team. You’re ready to test how the Finance team works to deliver the strategy 

## We’re looking for someone who:

* Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy 
* Is comfortable providing strategic recommendations to the Board and CEO, but is also happy to make themselves available to answer questions from anyone, at any level, across the business
* Is passionate about building, developing and managing a team
* Will become a true business partner across the Group and between key functional teams
* Is comfortable sitting at the intersection of strategy, technology and financial management, making the right decision to deliver on the group’s strategic intent

## It would be great if you also had:

* Experience working directly with Founders or business leaders
* Relevant practical work experience as Chief Financial Officer in a start-up or high-growth environment
* Experience in Superannuation or Wealth Management

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!

## You'll love working here with:

* A purpose-driven organisation and team, with the opportunity to help build and scale the business so we can have an even greater impact on climate change and inequality
* A proud B Corp organisation that cares about how it behaves inside and out
* Heaps of flexibility to fit work into your life (not your life around our work) and the opportunity to work with your manager to define what that looks like for you now and in the future
* Team lunches, team socials and company-wide events
* 14 weeks’ paid parental leave for all genders and a generous parental superannuation package, Employee Assistance Program (EAP), formal training and development with continuous improvement opportunities and membership to Bicycle NSW  (or your State’s equivalent) as part of our sustainable transport policy
* Future Super is an equal opportunity employer – we provide flexible working hours, the option to work from home and a laptop you can use to work remotely (this used to be a more differentiating dot-point, but it’s still true!)
