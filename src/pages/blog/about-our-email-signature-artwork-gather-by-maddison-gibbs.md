## About the artwork

Gather speaks to ancient and contemporary ceremonies. Taking time to collect, prepare and join together for sharing and listening time. We often use these ceremonies to reflect , celebrate and make future plans and goals. Gather is to acknowledge the past and what we have done as a collective to get to this point in time and a nod to new beginnings changes at this pivotal time in history. The time for Shifting paradigms and actioning change is now and a gathering and marking in time and space begins the shift.
