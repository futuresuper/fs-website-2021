### We know that annual superannuation statements can contain a lot of information, so we wrote this handy guide to help you understand the details. 

### Or if you’re more of a visual and audio kind of person, you can find our video explainer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycl6Vkksmww&ab_channel=FutureSuper).

### **Your Account Summary** 

The annual statement is a summary of your account in the past financial year (from 1 July 2021- 30 June 2022):

***Opening balance*** is the balance of your account at the start of the financial year on 1 July 2021.


***What’s been added*** includes funds allocated to your account, such as rollovers from your other super accounts, contributions (government, employer, and personal contributions, for 
your account). 


***What has been deducted*** from your account include deductions like taxes on your contributions, benefits paid (e.g. withdrawals or rollovers), insurance premiums and direct fees. (Fees are explained further below). Note, anything in brackets means a deduction or loss.


***Investment Earnings*** shows the net return (or loss) for the year. This is the net movement in value of your investment over the year, less any indirect fees or taxes. (Read more about this below).

***Closing balance*** is the balance at the end of the financial year (ending 30 June 2022). Please note, this is not your current balance.

### **Accessing Your Super**

Your account balance is broken into different components in the ‘Access Your Money’ section. 

***Preserved*** means you can only withdraw this money if you meet [a condition of release](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/what-is-a-condition-of-release/).


***Restricted non-preserved*** benefits generally stem from employment-related contributions (other than employer contributions) made before 1 July 1999. You can access this component of your super if that employment has terminated.


***Unrestricted non-preserved benefits*** are the funds in your account that you can withdraw without restriction.



### Investment Performance 


The total value shown here is your balance as at 30 June 2022:

***Units held*** means the number of units you own. Future Super is a unitised fund, which means that every time a contribution is made into your account, you are issued units in your chosen investment option. Your balance is therefore calculated as the number of units you hold multiplied by the unit price on any particular day.

***Unit price*** is the price for all members of the fund (the value of a unit) is calculated every weekday and changes based on the value of the assets the fund invests in, as well as the fees and taxes that are due and deducted from the value of the assets.



### H﻿ow Returns Are Calculated?

Your investment performance is displayed after the ***fees and costs deducted from your investment***. This includes the asset-based administration fee (% fee), investment fee and taxes are deducted (more on this below). 


This also means our[ published fund returns](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/performance-and-returns/) are shown after those fees and taxes are deducted.


Your personal investment performance may differ to the fund performance depending on when you rolled in, and when and how much you contributed during the financial year.

### Y﻿our Insurance Details
