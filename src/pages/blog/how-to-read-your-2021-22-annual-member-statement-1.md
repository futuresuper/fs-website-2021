We know that annual superannuation statements can contain a lot of information, so we wrote this handy guide to help you understand the details. 


Or if you’re more of a visual and audio kind of person, you can find our video explainer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycl6Vkksmww&ab_channel=FutureSuper).





#### Your Account Summary 


The annual statement is a summary of your account in the past financial year (from 1 July 2021- 30 June 2022)

***Opening balance*** is the balance of your account at the start of the financial year on 1 July 2021.


***What’s been added*** includes funds allocated to your account, such as rollovers from your other super accounts, contributions (government, employer, and personal contributions, for example) and tax rebates (you receive a tax rebate of 15% on direct fees deducted from your account).


***What has been deducted from your account*** include deductions like[ taxes on your contributions](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/why-is-tax-taken-from-my-account/), benefits paid (e.g. withdrawals or rollovers), insurance premiums and direct fees. (Fees are explained further below). Note, anything in brackets means a deduction or loss.


***Investment Earnings*** shows the net return (or loss) for the year. This is the net movement in value of your investment over the year, less any indirect fees or taxes. (Read more about this below).



***Closing balance*** is the balance at the end of the financial year (ending 30 June 2022). Please note, this is not your current balance.
