September is Supplier Diversity Month!

It’s also 12 months since Future Super started tracking our supplier diversity spend, so it’s a good time to reflect on how far we’ve come, and where we still need to improve.

A year ago, as part of our [B Corp](https://www.bcorporation.com.au/) recertification, we created our _Ethical and Local Supplier Guidelines._ These guidelines help us prioritise suppliers that are Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander-owned, women-led, local, independent and B Corp certified.

Future Super now screens potential companies _before_ we decide to spend our consumer dollars on them - to help us do this we’ve signed up to [Supply Nation](https://supplynation.org.au/), Australia’s largest national directory of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander-owned businesses\*, to use as our primary procurement source.

Some cool supplier choices we’ve made in the past year include:

- Choosing the [Aboriginal Carbon Fund](https://www.abcfoundation.org.au/), a Supply Nation certified company, to offset the carbon emissions of our business operations
- Using [Indigi-Print](https://indigi-print.com.au/), a Supply Nation certified printing company, for our office notebooks and printing
- Sending our team flowers from [The Floral Decorator](https://thefloraldecorator.com.au/), a Supply Nation certified and women-led florist in Sydney
- Ordering our beer and cider from B Corp certified drinks company [4 Pines](https://4pinesbeer.com.au/) (back when we were in the office!)
- Selecting[ Mirri Mirri](http://www.mirrimirri.com.au/), a First Nations training company, to deliver cultural competency training for our Board and senior management

Since September 2020, we’ve come a long way in increasing our spend on Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and women-led businesses from what were (shamefully) low starting points, and will continue to set targets to ensure we continue to focus our attention and improve these figures, year-on-year.

We’ve made our Ethical and Local Supplier Guidelines [open-source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-4us-BvtBUIq3g1DegEQblVoIqzoolmS7UkLqMyPc0/edit), so feel free to take a read, ask questions, and plagiarise as you wish!

\* Research shows that broadening supplier diversity, especially in the area of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander procurement, dramatically uplifts the economic and social impacts for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and other underrepresented communities.
