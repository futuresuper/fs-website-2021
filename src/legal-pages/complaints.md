## What does a complaint cost?

The entire Future Super complaints process is free of charge.

## What to do if you need assistance to make a complaint?

We know that accessing and understanding financial services can be difficult. If you think you may need assistance to lodge a complaint with Future Super, please contact us, or arrange for your representative to contact us. We will endeavour to assist you with lodging your complaint.

At Future Super, we have access to the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) and National Relay Service (NRS) if required. TIS is a national interpreting service for people who do not speak English and for business who need to communicate with them. The NRS can provide a range of services for hearing and speech impaired people.

## Is your complaint about the Trustee or one of our Partners (or both)?

Equity Trustees Superannuation Limited (Equity Trustees) is the Trustee of the Future Super superannuation fund and oversees the work of different partners that help run Future Super. This means that when you make a complaint about Future Super, it may relate to a product or service provided by one of our partners or to products or services provided by both us and our partners.

Our partners assist in providing services to you in several ways. They may help us offer insurance coverage to our members, provide administrative services, or provide claims management services to help us pay benefits. For more information about how our partners assist us with Future Super please refer to the Product Disclosure Statement, Additional Information Booklet, Target Market Determination and Insurance guide available from [the Fund's website](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/).

If your complaint relates to a product or service wholly provided by one of our partners, their complaints policy will apply to the complaint and not Equity Trustees policy. However, if you are a member or beneficiary of Future Super, we will still work with the relevant partner to ensure your complaint is managed appropriately.

If your complaint relates to products or services that both we and our partners provide, then Equity Trustees policy will apply, and we will work with the relevant service provider to ensure all of the issues you have raised in your complaint are managed appropriately.

## Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA)

If you are not satisfied with our internal dispute resolution (IDR) response, or we have not resolved your complaint within 45 days (or for death benefit distribution complaints, within 90 days), you can lodge a complaint with AFCA. AFCA provides fair and independent financial services complaint resolution that is free to consumers.

If we have not had an opportunity to resolve your complaint first, AFCA may ask us to work with you to investigate and respond to your complaint before they commence their process.

**Write to:** \
