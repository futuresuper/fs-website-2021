Insurance cover is provided to eligible members by AIA Australia Limited (ABN 79 004 837 861; AFSL 230043).

## Legal effect of documentation

The offer to invest in the Future Superannuation Fund is contained in the [Product Disclosure Statement](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/pds) (PDS) for this Fund. Anyone wishing to invest in the Fund will need to read the PDS and complete the relevant join form.

This website does not take the place of the legal document known as the [Trust Deed](/documents-and-forms/#trust-deed) which governs the operation of the Fund. The Trust Deed is binding on the Trustee, the Promoter and the members of the Fund. If any dispute arises concerning benefits or any other aspect of the Fund, the Trust Deed (and the law) will always be the final authority.

## About returns performance

Return of capital and the performance of your investment in the Fund is not guaranteed. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. Figures showing a period of less than one year have not been adjusted to show an annual total return. Figures for periods of greater than one year are on a per annum compound basis.

## Calculating returns for superannuation

Net investment returns are calculated using prescribed standard methods and assumptions, and take into account administration and investment fees, taxes and other costs. The standard calculations are based on a member with an account balance of $50,000, which will not be relevant to all members. The standard calculations do not allow for the effect of contributions to your account, insurance fees or various other matters.

## Transacting

Each investment option in the Fund is unitised. The unit price for each option is calculated every business day and takes into account any change in the value of the assets held by the investment options, as well as applicable fees and taxes. Every member of the Fund will have the same unit price for the relevant option applied to their investments. As the unit price fluctuates, so too will your account balance, as your balance is calculated as the number of units you hold, multiplied by the unit price on any particular day. For all benefit payments (including rollovers and withdrawals) and contributions, the unit price from the date when the contribution or benefit payment request was received will be used (provided that all relevant supporting information has also been received).

## Buy-sell spread

The buy-sell spread is an adjustment to the unit price to create a difference between the entry and exit price for the investment option. It is designed to cover the transaction costs when you make a contribution or a withdrawal so that these costs are not passed onto other investors. The buy-sell spread is built into the unit price and therefore does not appear on your member statements. The buy-sell spread is not paid to the manager of the Fund. The buy-sell spread for each investment option is reviewed from time to time and may change. If the buy-sell spread is changed, it will be updated on this website.

## Applications to invest

Applications to invest in the Fund can only be accepted if you live in Australia and must be made in Australian Dollars.
