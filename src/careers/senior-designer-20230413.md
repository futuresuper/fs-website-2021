The application will require answering short questions so give yourself time to complete it. We really want you to work for us, not AI, so please make sure your answers are your own. Once started, you can save and return to your application before submitting.

We use Applied as our de-identified recruitment platform, helping us reduce the risk of unconscious bias in our hiring process. If you are curious to know more about how it works, [check out this blog post.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-de-identified-recruitment-improving-diversity-our-veronica/?trackingId=0MnwcX%2BBRQSOTl0oogaIbA%3D%3D)

You’ll hear from us about a week or two after the closing date. If your application is successful, you’ll be invited to a 20 minute phone chat with someone from our People and Culture team. If your application missed out this time, we won’t ghost you, we’ll let you know and we’ll provide you with some feedback.\
\
Following the good old telephone call, should your application be successful again, you will be invited to a couple of interviews by Zoom.
