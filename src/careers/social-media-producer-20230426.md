We are looking for someone to join our purpose-led high-growth scaleup to be the voice of Future Super on social media. Our social media producer represents the brand across our social platforms: you’ll play a key role in driving conversations around Future Super and our mission.

If we were to tell you what a day in the life of a Social Media Producer would look like, it could flow like this:

* Collaborating with the marketing team on ideas and unblocking work
* You are bound to have a good time at work with your colleagues across the business
* You find the work fun, challenging and engaging
* You’re proud to show it off - it’s career-defining work 
* People on socials are talking about the content you are producing
* You are identifying new groups on social media for Future Super to explore partnerships with
* You’re equipped with endless story ideas 
* You have a work life balance - you know when to tap out or when to tune in 

Future Super Group is made up of unique people, we were started by activists, so you’ll cross paths with people in the climate movement, drag kings, animal lovers, film buffs to people who build apps in their spare time. 

We strongly encourage applications from people with diverse lived experience and identities, as the problems we face are complex, and the more diverse our team is, the better our solutions become. We are a team that is all about building a strong workplace culture, that's not only diverse, but competent. We are always learning and doing better together, and holding ourselves to account on our values.

Please get in touch to learn more about who we are before applying or if you need assistance applying.

#### You’ll love this job if:

* You find superannuation opaque and frustrating, if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would 
* You have an aptitude for telling stories about climate change and trying things out as a means to learn, you’re not that risk-averse or hurt when something doesn’t work, constantly learning fuels your fire 
* You know how to take people from apathy to action - working in climate can be a lot at times. But you’re constantly armed with hope when it comes to your ideas, you can cut through the anxiety and can turn it into action for the audience 
* You’re into collaborating with different people, you love pushing the boundaries and getting people talking about your work whether it's on socials or within the business
* You know whos in the know on social media and you’re not afraid to start a conversation with a climate org and kick off a partnership for social media

#### We’re looking for someone who:

* Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy 
* Has 2-4 years experience in social media, managing, creating and executing organic content across multiple platforms. 
* Isn’t afraid to try new things on social media in the name of engagement 
* Has self-awareness 

#### It would be great if you also had:

* Experience using Canva or Adobe and can mock up social posts or you know how to brief in creative. This would be a bonus but is not a deal breaker

#### As the social media producer you will:

* Bring our social strategy to life in creating, producing and executing content across our social media platforms
* Use insights to drive future creative content ideas
* Identify communities on social media and scope out opportunities for Future Super to partner with them 
* Community manage our social channels - a light hearted human approach is a must 
* Share and communicate creative insights to the marketing team and the business where fit
* Work closely with the Head of Comms 

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!
