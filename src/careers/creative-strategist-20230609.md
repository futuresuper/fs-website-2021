#### About Future Super

At Future Super, we’re making money moves and changing the way super is done. By giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet, we’re showing the power super has to change the world! 

We are looking for someone to join our purpose-led high-growth scaleup as Future Super’s first Creative Strategist to sit in our acquisition team.

Our creative strategist is the feedback loop between our creative and our data. This role works with the creative team to brief and shepherd work from idea to ‘live’. This includes project managing ad creative for Future Super’s digital paid channels all the way to ‘publish’ and then poring over creative effectiveness metrics to figure out what’s working and what’s not, then briefing what we need to make next to move the needle.

You’ll be working hand in glove with our Senior Performance Marketer to drive creative performance and experimentation to achieve the best results for Future Super and reach more people with the message that super can be used for climate action. You’ll play a pivotal role in shaping every piece of performance creative that hits the internet. Your North Star: briefing and producing creative that moves the needle. 

We strongly encourage applications from people with diverse lived experience and identities, as the problems we face are complex, and the more diverse our team is, the better our solutions become. We are a team that is all about building a strong workplace culture, that's not only diverse, but competent. We are always learning and doing better together, and holding ourselves to account on our values.

If you are Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander background, a person with a disability, someone from a cultural and linguistically diverse background, mature aged, LGBTQIA+ we would love for you to apply. Please get in touch to learn more about who we are before applying or if you need assistance applying.

#### You’ll love this job if:

* You find superannuation opaque and frustrating, if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would 
* The idea of being a foundational part of driving Future Super’s growth excites you
* You have a desire to test ideas and learn from success as well as failures (failing and learning is a big part of this role!)
* You’re brimming with ideas and love to roll up your sleeves and make things real, fast

#### We’re looking for someone who:

* Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy 
* Has 3-4 years growth marketing or social media and creative production experience 
* Can communicate with video editors and designers to create high quality video and still performance creative from concept to iterations and implementation - 
* Has creator empathy - you’re well aware of how much production an idea will take so that creators know what to create but also have an open line of communication about how they’re tracking
* Has strong knowledge of digital and social channels and how people spend time on platforms
* Has experience working with creative, design and content teams
* Has epic written and presentation skills, specifically when presenting and framing own creative ideas and direction
* Is excellent at managing time and projects; we always have multiple experiments running and a key part of this role is maintaining a cadence of creative output
* Is comfy with Canva and basic graphic design to message test 
* Has knowledge of analytics and A/B testing to optimise experiences and awareness of accessibility best practices in both design and development
* Is Committed to data-informed work, you’re not afraid to kill work that’s pretty, in favour of work that works

### It would be great if you also had:

* Some experience producing and shipping lo-fi performance video, stills and landing pages using low/ no code tools
* Low fi editing experience - you can roll your sleeves up and do in app editing like TikTok or CapCut for video editing, and Canva for stills, and no/low code landing pages (5% of role)

#### As the Creative Strategist you will:

* Own Future Super’s ad creative strategy and stay on top of industry trends and platform opportunities so that Future Super grows efficiently 
* Pore over creative effectiveness metrics on the daily, you’re constantly wondering what’s working and using that data to dream up more and different ways to reach prospective audiences
* Be a key contributor to the acquisition squad’s weekly creative strategy meeting by providing data informed creative analysis, sharing hypotheses and generating ad experiments to brief and test every week
* Brief designers and video editors to produce new and optimised creative ads
* Seek and listen to member interviews and focus groups and use insights from listening to existing and prospective members to shape the ad creative strategy

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!
