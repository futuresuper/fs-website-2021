#### About Future Super

At Future Super, we’re making money moves and changing the way super is done. By giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet, we’re showing the power super has to change the world! 

We are looking for someone to join our purpose-led high-growth scaleup as a creative copywriter to steward Future Super’s voice. This isn’t just a writing gig, though. You’ll play a key role in where Future Super’s verbal expression comes to life. Whether it’s writing lead emails that get shared on social media, busting out a monthly newsletter about the power of money that members rave about, or curating the sassiest member reviews to put on a billboard campaign in the wild, our brand copy is a core part of Future Super’s brand and sets the tone for everything we do.

Ideally, you’re bringing other skills along with you. The more skills you have, the more ideas you’ll be able to make. But at the end of the day, the core skill you’ve got? Churning out strategic, wacky, interesting copy & ideas that speak to people who want to use the power of their capital to fight the climate crisis.

Beyond that? You’ll get to work with a multi-disciplinary team that’s interested in shipping loads of impactful work to get people talking about the power of money and climate. Your work mates are people who can build apps, recite Aaron Sorkin’s body of work, and read your star chart.

We strongly encourage applications from people with diverse lived experience and identities, as the problems we face are complex, and the more diverse our team is, the better our solutions become. We are a team that is all about building a strong workplace culture, that's not only diverse, but competent. We are always learning and doing better together, and holding ourselves to account on our values.

If you are Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander background, a person with a disability, someone from a cultural and linguistically diverse background, mature aged, LGBTQIA+ we would love for you to apply. Please get in touch to learn more about who we are before applying or if you need assistance applying.

#### You’ll love this job if:

* You find superannuation opaque and frustrating, if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would 
* You find the advertising industry frustrating and you’re ready for your work to see the light of day
* You’re a seasoned writer and creative; you know how to write hard-hitting copy that converts
* You’ve had a load of experience writing everything from ads to web copy to emails to landing pages to instagram captions. 
* You’re an ideas machine: you’ve got a raft of ideas you’ve always wanted to try with the right, bold client
* You’ve got awards under your belt, but you’re more interested in making a ripple in the real world than in a ballroom or a conference room.

#### We’re looking for someone who:

* Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy 
* Can adopt our tone of voice; a good writer will adopt the style of the brand at hand.
* Is comfortable doing more than just copy. Future Super doesn’t rely on production companies to produce the creative, so you’ll have to be comfortable getting DIY with a small team of designers, writers and content creators. 
* Is comfortable with multiple projects and competing priorities. The team needs someone who can nail multiple briefs on the daily. 

#### As the Copywriter you will:

* Team up with growth product squads to make sure the onboarding experience makes sense from a communication perspective (and brings the Future Super voice to it all)
* Iterate on old transactional emails to turn them from something people delete into something people talk about
* Write multiple radio, podcast, video scripts to test as an advertising medium and seek feedback from acquisition and brand teams on your work
* Own our copy guidelines to bring our tone of voice principles to life in a consistent way across all channels
* Be a key collaborative partner to your creative colleagues across product, acquisition, and people and culture to inject the Future Super tone of hope and action into every piece of copy we release
* Work with the acquisition team to help concept, storyboard and script brand and best practice conversion campaigns for Meta and YouTube ads

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!

#### Why would you enjoy working at Future Super?
