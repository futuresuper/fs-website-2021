**About Future Group**

Future Group is not your traditional financial services company – we're a collective of super funds and services committed to changing our planet now for a better tomorrow. When you join us, you’ll become part of a team united by a clear and important mission: to lead the investment movement by advocating and campaigning for a future worth retiring into.



We are looking for someone to join our purpose-led high-growth scaleup. The Content Producer will play a key role in the communications team setting the content strategy and executing content relevant for the stable of Future Group brands (Future Super, Verve Super, smartMonday, Guild and Child Care Super and Future Group thought leadership content for LinkedIn). 



The role is also critical in providing engaging content that connects our members with the power of their money. 



And the best bit is you’ll get to work with some fantastic workmates. Our team are self-starters, creative, proactive storytellers, and they're a mixed bag of experience, from an ex-journo to a people & culture advisor who once moonlit as a lawyer to celebrity PR wrangler who then transitioned to sustainability comms and launched some of your favourite purpose-driven brands.



We strongly encourage applications from people with diverse lived experiences and identities, as the problems we face are complex, and the more diverse our team is, the better our solutions become. We are a team that is all about building a strong workplace culture, that's not only diverse but competent. We are always learning and doing better together, and holding ourselves to account for our values.



Future Group values lived experience and we encourage applications from people with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, who have caring responsibilities, from culturally and racially marginalised groups, people with disability, people who experience ageism, LGBTQIA+ people, and people who experience social exclusion because of their social class.



If you require any adjustments throughout the recruitment process, please reach out to our talent team at [careers@futuregroup.com.au](mailto:careers@futuresuper.com.au). We want to ensure our recruitment process is equitable for all, and we’ll happily make any reasonable adjustments where required.



**You’ll love this job if:**

* You find superannuation opaque and frustrating, if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would
* Y﻿ou thrive in dynamic, agile environments, and love driving outcomes
* Y﻿ou can sniff out an angle or story idea and know how to take it from idea to engaging informative content for the right audience
* You are described by others as being curious, collaborative, and take the work seriously but not yourself
* You exhibit a high degree of empathy and emotional intelligence allowing for the understanding and appreciation of diverse perspectives



**We’re looking for someone who:**

* Believes in Future Group’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil fuels and into sustainable solutions - we’re seeking value alignment because words and storytelling drive meaningful change. It is important for this role you believe in the power of money and the impact it can have on climate action and equality.
* Has at least 5-6 years of content writing experience. That experience being in the financial or superannuation industry is nice to have, but please do not be deterred from applying if your writing experience relates to other topics. If you are a passionate writer with an interest in super and financial topics, and can turn a complex issue into a compelling and engaging narrative, keep reading.
* Is adaptable and enjoys working with multiple stakeholders. This role is ideal for an experienced Content Producer who will work closely with the communications team as well as cross-functionally. 
* A self-starter. You get excited about the prospect of looking at a blank page, seeing the potential of a story and bringing it to life while helping the member or audience connect with their superannuation no matter what their life moment is. 
* Highly creative. We don’t want to sound like every other super fund. We are seeking authentic, engaging content that our members will want to engage with, delivered through a variety of channels. 
* An excellent writer. You need to be savvy enough to understand the ins and outs of super and tell a compelling story that your family or friends could understand. You must also have a talent for writing for a diverse audience. 
* A prioritisation ninja. You’ll be delivering content servicing multiple brands, and wearing different audience hats. You’ll need to be excellent at prioritising your time, getting stuff done and working towards the deadline. You need to be able to switch from strategic to tactical and back again, knowing what to prioritise and when. 
* Ear to the ground, you’re not afraid of information overload and you get a buzz from connecting the dots with multiple story angles that can be unearthed within the business.
* Details oriented - attention to detail is a must, but we also get it’s hard to have an eye for detail when you’re producing content on the reg. Detailed orientation is also more than just typos (although it is about typos), it is also about asking the right questions, not being afraid to challenge and being firm when something needs to end up on the cutting room floor or pushing an angle that can change the industry.  



**Some nice-to-haves but are not essential are:** 

* Some superannuation or financial services experience
* Experience at a scale-up
* Writing for lifestyle and an interest in equality, climate and social issues
* Self-aware and thrives being part of a fast-paced team



**A day in the life of a Content Producer could look like:**

* Editorial meetings with the communication team on setting content pillars and story angles for Future Group brands
* Working cross-functionally to identify and create compelling stories for members. Whether it is financial well-being and empowerment, gender equity, super as a form of climate action, interviewing activists to our CIO and crafting performance content so our members know how their retirement savings are performing for the long term or working with the product team to communicate important product updates for our members to drafting FAQs and scripts for our member servicing teams
* Using insights from teams to set advocacy narratives to drive industry change
* Crafting thought leadership pieces for LinkedIn that talk about our Group’s mission and the impact we are having within the industry as a responsible investor to a progressive employer



Don’t tick all the boxes?- that’s okay, we like thinking outside the box anyway. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job strikes a chord, we want to hear from you!
