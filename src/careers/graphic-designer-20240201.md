**About Future Group**

Future Group is more than a financial services company – we're a collective of super funds and services committed to changing our planet now for a better tomorrow. When you join us, you’ll become part of a team that’s united by a clear mission: to lead the investment movement to advocate and campaign for a future worth retiring into.

We are looking for someone to join our purpose-led high-growth scaleup to steward Future Group’s design and creative expression. Our designers are the custodians of our visual identity. But this isn’t just a design job: you’ll play a pivotal role in how we bring our ambition to life through our brand. Your north star: creating work people can’t help but talk about.

And you’ll get to work with some fantastic work mates. People who build apps in their spare time, have started clothing companies, can recite Aaron Sorkin’s life’s work, and who can read your star chart.

We strongly encourage applications from people with diverse lived experience and identities, as the problems we face are complex, and the more diverse our team is, the better our solutions become. We are a team that is all about building a strong workplace culture, that's not only diverse, but competent. We are always learning and doing better together, and holding ourselves to account on our values.

Future Group values lived experience and we encourage applications from people with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, who have caring responsibilities, from culturally and racially marginalised groups, people with disability, people who experience ageism, LGBTQIA+ people, and people who experience social exclusion because of their social class.
