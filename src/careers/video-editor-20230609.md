#### About Future Super

At Future Super, we’re making money moves and changing the way super is done. By giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet, we’re showing the power super has to change the world! 

We are looking for someone to join our mission focused high-growth scaleup to create videos that demonstrate the power super has. This is a new role in the creative team: while Future Super has published lots of videos, you will be our first dedicated in-house video editor with the opportunity to build the function from the ground up. But this role isn’t just about how Future Super moves: it’s about how Future Super moves people to take action. 

You’ll be the creative powerhouse behind Future Super’s videos. You constantly have your finger on the pulse of the Future Super member community and TikTok/Reels/YouTube at large. You’re not only aware of the relevant trends but you continue to develop and hone your video editing skills. You won’t do it in isolation, though, you’ll work with a creative strategist and performance marketer to analyse: where people drop off of our videos, what content stops them in their TikTok scroll, what gets them clicking, and optimise and create audience first, compelling content accordingly. You may not have had access to these analytics in previous roles, but you’re hungry to learn from them.

And you’ll get to work with some fantastic work mates. People who build apps in their spare time, have started clothing companies, can recite Aaron Sorkin’s life’s work, and who can read your star chart.

We strongly encourage applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people with disability, people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, mature age workers, people with caring responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) people. Seriously, the problems we face are complex and the more diversity of experiences we can bring to the table, the better our solutions become.

#### You’ll love this job if:

* You find superannuation opaque and frustrating, if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would 
* Getting to optimise your creative work based on how people are responding to it lights you up
* You find the advertising industry frustrating and you’re ready for your work to see the light of day
* You’re a seasoned creative; you know how to produce video that moves people

#### We’re looking for someone who:

* Believes in Future Super’s mission and has a passion for moving Australia’s money out of fossil-fuels and into renewable energy 
* Has 3+ years experience as a videographer and editor of video marketing assets and social content
* Can serve as a progressive thought leader on content storytelling, iss obsessed with keeping on top of the latest trends and best practices in the performance marketing world
* Will conceptualise, film, and edit up to 5 TikTok/Reels/YouTube videos per week aligning to the overall brand and performance marketing strategy
* Is willing to travel (if/when required) <10% of time
* Is skilled in, and energised by video editing. You’re a self-starter that can work independently
* Can prioritise multiple briefs ruthlessly and pragmatically.  
* Values progress over perfection, and is willing to try something new and if it doesn’t work, isn’t afraid to keep trying new approaches

#### It would be great if you also had:

* Experience orchestrating and managing small shoots, capturing vox-pops, interviewing contributors on camera, quickly assembling edits and completing fast turnaround videos when needed - you might come from a news production background
* Experience writing voiceover scripts 
* Strong art direction and brand strategy experience
* Deep understanding of storytelling across varied social formats

#### As the Video Editor you will:

* Shoot and edit video, sound and motion graphics for TikTok, Meta, YouTube performance creative as well as internal and campaign videos
* Work across Adobe creative suite, Da Vinci resolve and Canva to independently fulfil end-to-end post-production needs
* Deliver videos on time and on brief 
* Brainstorm concepts for social media creative, including understanding users behaviour on platform 
* Storyboard video concepts for stakeholder buy in and production
* Seek and listen to feedback from members, sit in on focus groups and interviews and use insights from listening to members to shape how we communicate 

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!
