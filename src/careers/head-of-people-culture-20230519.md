**About Future Super Group**

At Future Super Group we use business as a force for good - both in terms of how we run our super fund, and how we take care of our employees. We’re changing the way super is done, by giving people a chance to invest their life savings in companies that don’t harm the planet. 

We are looking for a Head of People & Culture (12-month, fixed-term contract - parental leave cover) to join our purpose-led, high-growth scaleup. You will play a key role in shaping and fostering our culture and driving growth and transformation, while also supporting the People & Culture team to do their best work. A member of the executive team, you will also act as a strategic advisor to the CEO, Board and senior leadership team.

We strongly encourage applications from people with diverse lived experience and identities as the problems we face are complex, and the more diverse our team is, the better our solutions become. We are a team that is all about building a strong workplace culture, that's not only diverse, but competent. We are always learning and doing better together, and holding ourselves to account on our values.

If you are of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander background, a person with a disability, someone from a cultural and linguistically diverse background, mature aged, LGBTQIA+ we would love for you to apply. Please get in touch to learn more about who we are before applying, or if you need any assistance with the application process.

**You’ll love this job if you:**

* Find superannuation opaque and frustrating; if you had the chance to revolutionise the industry to be better for people, you would 
* Get energised by the idea of building and scaling our people frameworks as we grow, while still maintaining and fostering our progressive, inclusive workplace culture
* Would happily move between leading strategically and “blue sky” thinking, to developing and supporting your team members and direct reports, to getting your hands dirty “on the tools” - sometimes all in the same day!
* Are a strong communicator and problem solver, with a talent for building relationships across all levels of a business
* Are strongly committed to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and have experience developing and implementing initiatives that promote a more inclusive and equitable workplace 
* Are keen to work in a purpose-led business that wants to do things differently

**We’re looking for someone who:**

* Is progressive, open-minded and passionate about making Future Super Group a place where people can do their best work
* Brings their whole self to work - an engaging leader who inspires people to be their best
* Has broad People & Culture experience across all aspects of the employee lifecycle, including talent acquisition, employee relations, employee engagement, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, payroll, wellbeing, Workplace Health & Safety, organisational development, performance management and learning and development. 
* Is experienced in leading implementation of strategic projects and deliverables, as well as organisational transformation initiatives
* Thrives in a scaleup environment and is comfortable designing and improving processes as needed
* Will work with the People & Culture team to ensure that everyone feels valued and supported as we navigate growth and change as a business
* Cares deeply about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and is able to consider all of their work through this lens 
* Isn’t above jumping in and lending a hand to members of the People & Culture team if they find themselves a bit stretched

**It would be great if you also had experience:**

* Working directly with an executive team, and providing recommendations to a CEO and Board
* Overseeing and supporting change management and transformation

Don’t tick all the boxes? That’s okay, we like thinking outside the box. We value skills, passion and who you are over what you’ve done or where you’ve studied. So if this job resonates with you, we want to hear from you!
