Complete this form if you are already a member of the Future Super fund, and would like to rollover some money from another super fund into your Future Super account.

*Please note: If you rollover your entire balance, your other super account will automatically be closed, and any insurance attached to your account will be cancelled. You will no longer be able to file a notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for any personal super contributions made to your other account once it is exited*.
