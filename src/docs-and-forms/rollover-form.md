You can make a transfer from another super fund before you commence taking income payments from your Future Super Pension Plan. The best way to do this is by providing your rollover details on the online pension application form. You can also do this by completing the Rollover Form. Once you are receiving an income from your Future Super Pension Plan, you are unable to make additional rollovers to your account.

*Please note if you rollover your entire balance, your other super account will automatically be closed, and any insurance attached to your account will be cancelled. You will no longer be able to file a notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for any personal super contributions made to your other account once it is exited*.
