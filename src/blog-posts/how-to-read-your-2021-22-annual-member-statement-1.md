**We know that annual superannuation statements can contain a lot of information, so we wrote this handy guide to help you understand the details.**

### Your Account Summary

**The annual statement is a summary of your account in the past financial year (from 1 July 2022- 30 June 2023)**

![](https://i.postimg.cc/zGHNstpr/account-summary-no-SG-personal-and-governemnt.png)

The ***Opening balance*** is the balance of your account as at the start of the financial year on 1 July 2022. 

***What has been added*** includes funds allocated into your account. This includes things such as: 

* Rollovers from other super accounts
* Contributions (including employer, person and government contributions)
* Tax rebates (you receive a tax rebate of 15% on direct fees deducted from your account). You can read more about this in your fees section below 

What has been deducted from your account include deductions like [taxes on your contributions](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/why-is-tax-taken-from-my-account/), any benefits paid out of your account (such as withdrawals or rollovers), insurance premiums and direct fees. 

Note, anything in brackets in a transaction listing here denotes a deduction or loss.

***Investment earnings*** show the net return (or loss) for the year. This is the net movement in value of your investment over the year, less any indirect fees or taxes. (Read more about this below).

The ***Closing balance*** is the balance at the end of the financial year at 30 June 2023. Please note, this is not your current balance. To view your current balance, you can login to your online account or [contact us](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/contact-us/). 

### Investment Information

***Units held*** means the number of units you own. Future Super is a unitised fund, which means that every time a contribution is made into your account, you are issued units in your chosen investment option. Your balance is therefore calculated as the number of units you hold multiplied by the unit price on any particular day.

***Unit price*** is the price for all members of the fund (the value of a unit). The price is calculated every weekday and changes based on the value of the assets the fund invests in, as well as the fees and taxes that are due and deducted from the value of the assets. You can see the current and historical unit price for each investment option on [our website here](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/unit-prices/). 

The ***Total value*** shown here is your balance as at 30 June 2023.

### A﻿ccessing Your Super

Your account balance is broken into different components in the ‘Access Your Money’ section.

Your** *Preserved benefit*** means you can only withdraw this money if you meet a [condition of release](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/what-is-a-condition-of-release/).

***Restricted non-preserved benefits*** generally stem from employment-related contributions (other than employer contributions) made before 1 July 1999. You can access this component of your super if that employment has terminated.

***Unrestricted non-preserved benefits*** are the funds in your account that you can withdraw without restriction.

### Investment Performance

### How returns are calculated

Your investment performance is displayed after the ***fees and costs deducted from your investment***. This includes the asset-based administration fee (% fee), investment fee and taxes are deducted (more on this below).

This also means our[](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/choosing/performanceandreturns)[published fund returns](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/performance-and-returns/) are shown after those fees and taxes are deducted.

Your personal investment performance may differ to the fund performance depending on when you rolled in, and when and how much you contributed during the financial year.

### Y﻿our Insurance Details
