**We know that annual superannuation statements can contain a lot of information, so we wrote this handy guide to help you understand the details.**

**Or if you’re more of a visual and audio kind of person, you can find our video explainer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycl6Vkksmww&ab_channel=FutureSuper).**

### Your Account Summary

The annual statement is a summary of your account in the past financial year (from 1 July 2021- 30 June 2022)

![](https://i.postimg.cc/bJPc0NSg/Account-Summary-2-m3jfjg-2022.jpg)

**_Opening balance_** is the balance of your account at the start of the financial year on 1 July 2021.

**_What’s been added_** includes funds allocated to your account, such as rollovers from your other super accounts, contributions (government, employer, and personal contributions, for example) and tax rebates (you receive a tax rebate of 15% on direct fees deducted from your account).

**_What has been deducted from your account_** include deductions like[ taxes on your contributions](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/why-is-tax-taken-from-my-account/), benefits paid (e.g. withdrawals or rollovers), insurance premiums and direct fees. (Fees are explained further below). Note, anything in brackets means a deduction or loss.

** _Earnings_** shows the net return (or loss) for the year. This is the net movement in value of your investment over the year, less any indirect fees or taxes. (Read more about this below).

**_Closing balance_** is the balance at the end of the financial year (ending 30 June 2022). Please note, this is not your current balance.

### A﻿ccessing Your Super

Your account balance is broken into different components in the ‘Access Your Money’ section.

**_Preserved benefit_** means you can only withdraw this money if you meet a [condition of release](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/what-is-a-condition-of-release/).

**_Restricted non-preserved benefits_** generally stem from employment-related contributions (other than employer contributions) made before 1 July 1999. You can access this component of your super if that employment has terminated.

**_Unrestricted non-preserved benefits_** are the funds in your account that you can withdraw without restriction.

### Investment Performance

The **_total value_** shown here is your balance as at 30 June 2022.

**_Units held_** means the number of units you own. Future Super is a unitised fund, which means that every time a contribution is made into your account, you are issued units in your chosen investment option. Your balance is therefore calculated as the number of units you hold multiplied by the unit price on any particular day.

**_Unit price_** is the price for all members of the fund (the value of a unit) is calculated every weekday and changes based on the value of the assets the fund invests in, as well as the fees and taxes that are due and deducted from the value of the assets.

### How returns are calculated

Your investment performance is displayed after the **_fees and costs deducted from your investment_**. This includes the asset-based administration fee (% fee), investment fee and taxes are deducted (more on this below).

This also means our[](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/choosing/performanceandreturns)[published fund returns](https://www.myfuturesuper.com.au/performance-and-returns/) are shown after those fees and taxes are deducted.

Your personal investment performance may differ to the fund performance depending on when you rolled in, and when and how much you contributed during the financial year.

### Total Fees You Paid

![](https://i.postimg.cc/SsQrWwd3/Screen-Shot-2022-12-21-at-6-06-40-pm.png)

The **_total fees and costs you paid_** is made up of **_fees deducted directly from your account_** and the **_fees and costs deducted from your investment_**. This may differ depending on the investment option you have chosen to be in. A more detailed breakdown of fees can be found from [pages 26-30 of the Additional Information Booklet](https://content.myfuturesuper.com.au/forms-docs/FS_AIB_20122022.pdf).

**_Fees deducted directly from your account_** are the fees deducted directly from your account that appear in your transaction history. This includes the dollar-based administration fee.

**_Fees and costs deducted from your investment_** include most of your percentage-based fees are deducted when calculating your investment earnings figure. This includes the asset-based administration fee (%) and your investment fee. These don’t appear in your transaction history.

This amount also includes indirect costs met by reserves and costs paid by third parties; these amounts are not deducted from your investment earnings but are a representation of the costs incurred to operate the fund.
