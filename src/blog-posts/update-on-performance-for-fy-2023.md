**The big picture: what impacted returns in FY23**

As a Future Super member, your super is invested all over the world. It’s invested in shares, bonds, property, infrastructure and more. That means there are a lot of factors that influence the performance of your super. 

Let’s start by looking back - the 2022 financial year presented extremely challenging market conditions, with nearly all asset classes down. As a result, last year we experienced negative returns across all investment options. One significant factor in that result was fossil fuel prices spiking following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Future Super did not benefit from the spike in fossil fuel prices because we screen out fossil fuel companies. 

If 2022’s returns had some doubting whether ethical funds could deliver, then 2023’s strong returns should provide a powerful counterpoint. 

In fact, this year Future Super’s screening strategy gave us an edge. Screening out direct and indirect exposure to fossil fuels put our equities investments in a particularly strong position. 

For example, we screen out many of the big banks, locally and internationally, because they fund fossil fuel projects. Financial year performance for the banking sector remained below broad index returns.

Additionally, our investment strategy in equities (that’s stocks traded on share markets) benefited from a bias towards tech. The tech sector globally continues to deliver growth. 

**What’s next?** 

We do anticipate challenging conditions throughout FY24. Interest rate rises mean it’s a difficult environment to be investing in property and infrastructure because it’s harder for the companies building those projects to borrow money. More broadly, interest rate rises, increased geopolitical tensions and inflation contribute to uncertain economic conditions all over the world. 

Of course, these challenges do not mean that we waver on our ethical mandate and approach to screening. We retain the conviction that over the long term, as governments and companies meet net zero commitments, economies will continue to allocate resources to renewables and emissions reduction. We believe that companies and assets benefitting from this macro theme offer strong long term investment opportunities for super funds.
