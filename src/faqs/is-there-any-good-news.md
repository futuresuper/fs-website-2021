We’re keeping your money away from fossil fuel companies that are contributing to catastrophic climate change. By being a Future Super member, you are part of the divestment movement - a movement of investors using money for good and investing in a way that seeks to reduce climate change and inequality.

We invest in all different types of assets with superior environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations. To give you an example, we have invested in the IIG Solar Asset Fund, a renewable energy investment that owns three large-scale solar farms - Swan Hill, Chinchilla and Brigalow.  Those solar assets are an example of investing in assets that aim to contribute to our overall performance while at the same time building clean energy solutions.\*

When markets go down it can be a buying opportunity. And so, whilst it might be scary to see a graph go down, another way of thinking about this is it can be an opportunity to benefit from buying assets when they're cheaper.

_\*﻿  Future Super has exposure to these assets through its investment in the IIG Solar Impact Fund. Members invested in the Future Super Balanced Impact and Future Super Renewables Plus Growth options have exposure to the IIG Solar Impact Fund. Members in the Future Super Balanced Index option do not have any exposure to this investment._
