If you don't know your Tax File Number (TFN), you might be able to find it by:

- Looking at your income tax notice of assessment or other letters from the ATO
- Looking at a payment summary (provided by your employer)
- If you have a myGov account linked to the ATO Online Services, you can access your TFN [online](https://my.gov.au/LoginServices/main/login)

If you still can't find it, you can contact the ATO on [13 28 65](tel:132865).
