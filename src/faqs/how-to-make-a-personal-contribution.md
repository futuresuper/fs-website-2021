If you’d like to grow your super balance, you can make [personal contributions](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/how-to-save-more-in-your-super/personal-super-contributions/) to your super directly from your bank account.



**How to make a personal contribution to your Future Super account**

You can use BPAY to make a payment (or recurring payments) from your bank account.

To find our BPAY biller code and your unique BPAY reference, log in to your Future Super [online account](https://my.futuresuper.com.au) and navigate to ***Contributions > Make a contribution***.

Once we receive your contribution, our administrators will allocate it to your account. Please allow 2-10 business days for your contribution to be processed and appear in your transactions. 

There are several types of voluntary contributions, including personal, spouse, and Downsizer contributions. To make a spouse or Downsizer contribution, you’ll need to submit a [Alternative Contribution Form](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/alternativecontributionform). Please see the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)’s website for more information on [different contribution types](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/how-to-save-more-in-your-super/).

 

**Annual contribution caps and tax deductions** 

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) sets an annual contribution cap (per financial year), and if you go over this cap you may be required to pay additional tax - you can [see more information here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/Caps-limits-and-tax-on-super-contributions/). For the 2023/2024 financial year, the standard cap amounts are [$110,000 for non-concessional contributions](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/caps-limits-and-tax-on-super-contributions/non-concessional-contributions-cap/), and [$27,500 for concessional contributions](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/caps-limits-and-tax-on-super-contributions/concessional-contributions-cap/) per financial year. 

If you claim a tax deduction for your personal contributions, they become concessional contributions and are effectively from your pre-tax income. They will then be taxed in your fund at a rate of 15%. If you don't claim a tax deduction for them, they're non-concessional contributions and are from your after-tax income or savings. 

If you wish to claim your personal contributions as a tax deduction, you need to submit a valid [Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions form *(NAT 71121)*](https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/Notice-of-intent-to-claim-or-vary-a-deduction-for-personal-super-contributions/) (or *Notice of intent*). You can find further instructions about how to make a [claim on the ATO website here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/How-to-save-more-in-your-super/Personal-super-contributions/), and more information on [how and when to submit a Notice of intent](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/when-should-i-submit-a-notice-of-intent-for-a-personal-contribution/) in our [FAQs](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/support-and-faqs/).

 

**From 22 July 2023, some changes apply.**

* **Starting from 1 November 2023 we have moved to BPAY only**, **and no longer accept direct deposit payments for voluntary contributions.** We also no longer require a contribution form for personal contributions.
* Our BPAY biller code and bank details were updated on 22 July 2023 - if you have saved our BPAY details in the past, you may need to update the Biller code saved in your bank account. Your individual BPAY reference number remains the same.
