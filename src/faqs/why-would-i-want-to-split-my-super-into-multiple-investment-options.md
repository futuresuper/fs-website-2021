There are a few reasons why you might want to split your super. Here are the main ones: 

* **You might want exposure to investments that are offered in different options.** For example, you might want the exposure to the growth assets in High Growth and the exposure to renewables and climate change solutions in Renewables Plus Growth. 
* **You might be thinking about fees**. For example, Future Super’s Balanced Index option has lower fees compared to our other options - that might be appealing to you but you might also want exposure to some of the investments in High Growth or Renewables Plus Growth. By splitting your balance, you could be charged the lower percentage based fee on the portion of your super you put into Balanced Index and then the slightly higher percentage-based fee for the portion you put in another option. 
* **You might want to tailor how much risk you are taking on**. The High Growth option has a higher risk level than Future Super’s other investment options, predominantly because it has a 90% allocation to growth assets and only 10% to defensive assets. You might not be comfortable taking on that much risk. By splitting your super balance across multiple options with different risk levels you can customise the risk you are taking on to be sure that you are comfortable with it.
