You can make additional contributions to your super account by completing the **_make a personal contribution form_** available in the **Actions** menu of your [online account](https://my.futuresuper.com.au/) and then making a payment via direct transfer or BPAY.

Your personal payment details (like your BPAY reference number) will be shown in the online form.

If you wish to claim your personal contributions for tax purposes, you will need to complete a **[Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions form](http://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/n71121-11-2014_js33406_w.pdf)**. You can read more about this [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms/notice-of-intent-to-claim-or-vary-a-deduction-for-personal-super-contributions/).

**_Note - An annual contribution cap applies to personal contributions, and if you breach this cap, you may be required to pay additional tax._**

For the 2023/24 financial year, the contribution caps are $110,000 for non-concessional contributions (contributions made from after-tax income which you do not claim a tax deduction for), and $27,500 for concessional contributions (taxed contributions), per financial year.

For more information on contribution caps, please refer to this ATO [webpage](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Super-contributions---too-much-can-mean-extra-tax/).
