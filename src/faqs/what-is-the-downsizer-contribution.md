If you are aged 65 or over and have recently sold your home, you may be able to make a voluntary super contribution of up to $300,000 from the proceeds of sale. [Eligibility criteria apply.](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Downsizer-contributions-for-individuals/?anchor=Howyouwillknowifyouareeligible#Howyouwillknowifyouareeligible)

Downsizer contributions **do not** count towards contribution caps and you will not need to meet the work test.

However, Downsizer contributions **do** count toward the $1.7m [transfer balance cap](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/withdrawing-and-using-your-super/transfer-balance-cap/) for transferring super into the retirement phase.

There are a number of requirements to assess your eligibility for the Downsizer contribution. You can read more about the eligibility requirements on the ATO website [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Growing-your-super/Adding-to-your-super/Downsizing-contributions-into-superannuation/).

**_You should consider speaking with a professional financial advisor before making any financial decisions._** \
