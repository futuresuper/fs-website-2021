At Future Super we take the security of your account very seriously.

The only way we’ll contact you is via our phone number or email address listed on our [](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/contact-us/) [Contact Us](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/contact-us/) page. You may also receive text notifications via SMS for authentication purposes or app notifications if you use the Future Super app.

 

**We will never call you from a standard mobile number.**\
If you think you’ve been targeted by someone who is trying to access your super, or your identity details have been leaked, report it straight away.

1. Let us know by emailing **info@futuresuper.com.au** or calling **1300 658 422**. You can see our contact hours and more on our [](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/contact-us/) [Contact Us](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/contact-us/) page.

**What should I look out for?** 

**Be careful where you share your information**\
If scammers gain enough of your personal details, they may be able to create a super account in your name with another fund, or their own Self Managed Super Fund, then transfer your balance to this account. They may also gain access to your myGov log in and any accounts attached to it.

**Scam calls** \
Cold callers might reach out claiming to be from a financial firm. They may give you the details of a legitimate financial advisory to reassure you, and ask you for information on your super account to provide “advice”:

* Don’t give out your personal information to cold callers. 
* If you’d like to speak to an organisation, or check that a call is legitimate, look up the organisation’s official website and directly call the phone number listed there.
* *Hang up or cut contact with callers asking for your personal details or threatening you.*

 **Phishing emails or texts**\
Scam or phishing emails may look legitimate but they’re designed ~~to~~ to steal your details or trick you into transferring money. Signs of a phishing message include: 

* The email address doesn't match the company name (e.g. from [](http://gmail.com) [gmail.com](http://gmail.com) instead of [](http://futuresuper.com.au) [futuresuper.com.au](http://futuresuper.com.au).) Always check the actual email address of the sender, not just the displayed name.
* There are spelling mistakes or the information doesn't make sense.
* You're asked to update or confirm your personal details, including passwords.
* You're being notified your details have been leaked, and the email asks you to click through a link to secure your details.
* You're asked for immediate payment.
* You're asked to click to prevent the transfer of any funds from your account.

*Don't click on any links. Report and delete the email or message straight away.*
