To login to your Future Super account, you’ll need to set up an authenticator and pair it with your Future Super account.

You can link your Future Super account with any authenticator, but we can’t guarantee they’ll work as intended. For maximum compatibility, we recommend the Microsoft Authenticator app from the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Microsoft%20Authenticator&c=apps&hl=en&gl=AU) Store (for Android devices) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) (for iPhone and iOS devices).

If you’ve successfully set up your authenticator but your code isn’t being accepted, or you’ve reset your password but can’t log in, your browser may be trying to use outdated data.

To fix this, please clear your browser cache and try again.

The steps to clear your cache and cookies are different depending on the system and browser you're using. See your browser's support page for instructions. Common browsers include [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/?hl=en), [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-au/safari), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge).

Other troubleshooting tips:

* The codes refresh every 30 seconds. If there’s only a few seconds left, wait for a new code.
* If your code still doesn’t work, check if your Future Super login is only saved to one authenticator application. Your details can be saved in more than one place – but only one set of codes will be synced with our website. 
* If your authenticator app generates any codes longer than 6-digits, our login system won’t accept them.



#### Why can’t I just receive a text or email code? 
In May 2023 the federal regulator [Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) released new security advice](https://www.apra.gov.au/use-of-multi-factor-authentication-mfa), recommending that superannuation funds should move towards requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA).

As phishing texts and emails are on the rise, the most up-to-date cybersecurity advice is to move away from SMS and email authentication and towards [more secure methods such as authenticator apps or software (as advised by the Australian Cyber Security Centre)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/protect-yourself/resources-protect-yourself/personal-security-guides/protect-yourself-multi-factor-authentication). With this advice in mind, Future Super made the decision to use app-based MFA in our update.
