3. Enter the name of your other fund in the **Name of super fund** field. This should automatically start searching for your fund. You might notice there are a few options for some super funds, so make sure you have the following details of your other fund to find the correct one:

- USI (Unique Superannuation Identifier), which you can find on [the government Super Fund Lookup website](https://superfundlookup.gov.au/Tools/USI)
- ABN (Australian Business Number)

4. Enter your member number for your other super fund in the **Member number** field.
5. Select the amount you would like to transfer. You can either choose to transfer your whole balance or a specific amount. (If you select a specific amount, a space will appear for you to enter the dollar amount).

Please note, if you choose to transfer your whole balance, this will automatically close your old account as well as any insurance policy or other benefits attached to it. You should consider this before making a decision to rollover.

Rollover can take 3-7 business days to process. You will be able to view the transaction within your [online account](https://my.futuresuper.com.au/) once processed.

#### Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs)

To transfer funds from your Self-Managed Super Funds(SMSF) to your Future Super account, this will need to be arranged by the SMSF administrator.

Please get in touch with us at info@futuresuper.com.au or call us on 1300 658 422 for further information.
