title: How does a unitised fund work?

Future Super is a unitised fund, which means that every time a contribution is made into your account, you are issued units in your chosen investment option. This also means that when you are paid a benefit or money is deducted from your account (for example, for fees or insurance premiums), a portion of your unit holdings are sold.

Your balance is therefore calculated as the number of units you hold multiplied by the unit price on any particular day.
