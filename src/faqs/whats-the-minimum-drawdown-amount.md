Pension account holders receiving an income stream have to withdraw at least the minimum pension payment from their super, as part of their annual income stream. This is known as the minimum pension drawdown.

The [annual minimum drawdown amount](<https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?page=9#:~:text=As%20the%20pension%20commenced%20on,a%20leap%20year)%20%3D%20%246%2C215.>) is set by the government and changes depending on your age.

To see more details on the minimum drawdown amount that applies to you, please see Table 11 at the bottom of [this ATO page](https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?anchor=Minimumannualpaymentsforsuperincomestrea#Minimumannualpaymentsforsuperincomestrea). You can also find this information on page 8 of our [Pension PDS](https://content.myfuturesuper.com.au/forms-docs/FS_PPPDS_01072023.pdf).

To assist pensioners through the pandemic, the Government has reduced the minimum drawdown amount by 50% until the end of the 2022-23 financial year.
