**When you log in for the first time after our November system upgrade, you’ll need to set up an authenticator and pair it with your Future Super account.**  

Part of the improved security on your account from this update was including multi-factor authentication (MFA) security for member log-ins. We decided to include this feature based on [the newest security advice from the federal regulator](https://www.apra.gov.au/use-of-multi-factor-authentication-mfa) for most superannuation funds [(Australian Prudential Regulation Authority)](https://www.apra.gov.au/use-of-multi-factor-authentication-mfa).

You can try using any authenticator app. For maximum compatibility, we recommend the Microsoft Authenticator app from the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=ms+authenticator+app&c=apps&hl=en&gl=AU) Store (for Android devices) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) (for iPhone and iOS devices).

If you don’t want to or aren’t able to download an app on your phone, there are authenticator programs available as desktop programs (for your computer) or browser plug-ins (for computers, phones and tablets). Some password managers also have an authenticator built in. If you’re using an iPhone running iOS Version 15 or later, you can use your phone’s built in Passwords feature.  

While we can’t recommend any other specific authenticator or password manager as best for your personal needs, many tech websites online provide articles comparing and reviewing options.

Once you choose and install an authenticator, you’ll need to make an account. The authenticator or password manager is essentially a safe, and the account you’re making is the master key.

### **How to set up an authenticator with your Future Super account**

**Step 1** — Enter your details on the Future Super [login page](https://my.futuresuper.com.au/).

**Step 2** — You’ll be taken to a second screen to set up multi-factor authentication. 

* If you’re using Microsoft Authenticator on your phone, click on ‘+’ symbol to add a new log-in, and select to scan the QR code on your screen. (See ‘[How to add non-Microsoft accounts to the Microsoft Authenticator app](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/account-billing/add-non-microsoft-accounts-to-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-7a92b5d4-d6e5-4474-9ac6-be0b6773f574)’ at Microsoft Support for help.)
* If you’re using a different authenticator, follow their instructions to add your Future Super account details. It’s usually the ‘+’ or ‘Add account’ option.
* If you can’t scan the QR code, or aren’t using a phone, click ‘Can’t scan? Try this’ to receive a manual pairing code.

**Step 3** — Click on the ‘Continue’ button once you’ve paired the authenticator using either the QR or manual code. Once your Future Super account is saved in your authenticator’s ‘vault’, you should see a six digit verification code being generated and refreshing every 30 seconds. 

**Step 4** — Enter the 6-digit verification code and click on the ‘Verify’ button to finalise logging in.

You should now see your new Future Super account home page!

### Troubleshooting tips

* The codes refresh every 30 seconds. If there’s only a few seconds left, wait for a new code.
* If you’ve successfully set up your authenticator but your code isn’t being accepted, please clear your browser cache* and try again.
* If your code still doesn’t work, check if your Future Super log in is only saved to one authenticator application. Your details can be saved in more than one place – but only one set of codes will be synced with our website.
* If your authenticator app generates codes that are longer or shorter than 6-digits, our system won’t accept them. You’ll need to see if your authenticator settings can be changed, or try a different app.
