Electronic Service Addresses (ESAs) are used primarily by self-managed super funds (SMSFs).

Future Super is not an SMSF but an APRA-regulated fund, so you won't need an ESA. Please see below for all the information your employer will need to make contributions into your Future Super account.

**Registration details for Future Super are as follows:**

* ABN: 45 960 194 277
* USI: 45 960 194 277 010
* Fund registration number: R1072914

Your employer can find out more information about how to pay your super contributions in our [Employer Hub](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/employers/).\
