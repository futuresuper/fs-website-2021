Our bank account and BPAY details have changed, effective from 22 July 2023.

* Any contributions received using our old details after 21 July 2023 will be returned. Please allow 5-20 working days for refunds to be received by your bank.

The new bank details can be found[ inside your online account](https://my.futuresuper.com.au/#/login), on the final page of the ‘Make a personal contribution’ form.

When you complete the [Personal contribution form](https://my.futuresuper.com.au/#/login), you’ll be given either the unique BPAY code or Direct Deposit reference to use when making contributions. This will identify the funds as belonging to your account, as well as the type of contribution you intended it to be (e.g. personal or spouse).

* If you're making a payment using BPAY, you need to either complete the Personal contribution form to see your individual reference number, or contact our team directly.  
* If you’ve made previous payments via BPAY, you'll only need to update the biller code - your individual reference is linked to your member number and remains the same. 
* If you don’t have access to or don’t use your online account, you can manually fill out the PDF version of our Personal Contribution form - it’s available for download on our Documents and forms page.  

For complete instructions on how to make a personal contribution, see [How do I make personal contributions to my account?](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/how-do-i-make-personal-contributions-to-my-account/) on our [Support and FAQs page](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/support-and-faqs/).

Please note that the change in bank accounts does not affect any employer contributions, and your employer doesn’t need to update any details. Your employer makes payments through a clearing house, which uses our Australian Business Number (ABN) and Unique Superannuation Identifier (USI) instead of bank details. For regulatory reasons, we cannot accept any employer contributions made via Direct Deposit or BPAY.

If you have any questions, please reach out to our team at info@futuresuper.com.au or give us a call at 1300 658 422.
