You can access money from your pension account at any time via either requesting an ad hoc pension payment or a withdrawal

1. **_Ad Hoc Payment_**
   An ad hoc pension payment counts towards your annual minimum drawdown amount. To request an ad hoc payment, you must email us from the email address we have on file for you with the following exact wording:

   _"I, (insert full name) born on (insert date of birth), wish to request an ad hoc pension payment for account (insert account number for pension account) for the amount of (insert amount)"_

   If you are under 60, the amount specified in your request will be considered the gross amount. Ad hoc payments are subject to the same tax treatment as your pension payments.

   You can email this to us at info@myfuturesuper.com. Generally, provided an ad hoc is received before COB Thursday, your payment will be received by the Tuesday of the next week.

2. **_Withdrawal Payment_**\
   A withdrawal payment does not count towards your annual minimum drawdown amount but your transfer balance cap will be reduced by the amount of the withdrawal.

   To request a withdrawal, you need to submit a withdrawal form either via email (to info@myfuturesuper.com.au) or post at:
   GPO Box 2754
   Brisbane QLD 4001

   If you are under 60, the amount specified in your withdrawal request will be considered the gross amount. Withdrawals may be subject to a different tax treatment as your pension payments.

   The form must be signed with a wet signature (i.e. with a pen on paper) and needs to be submitted along with identification (electronic ID details on the form OR certified ID attached).

   Withdrawals can take up to 10 business days to fully process.
