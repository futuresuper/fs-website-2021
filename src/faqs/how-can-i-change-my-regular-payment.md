You can choose your regular retirement income to be paid from your pension account monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually, to your nominated bank, building society or credit union account.

Your pension payment will be credited to your account on the 15th of the month (or the next business day if the 15th falls on a weekend or public holiday).

You can vary the amount and frequency of these payments at any time to suit your needs as long as you meet the minimum drawdown requirements.

If you would like to change the frequency of your payments, please contact us at info@futuresuper.com.au. Please ensure you contact us from the email address we have on file for you and you provide a confirmation of 3 points of ID (e.g. your member number, full name and date of birth) in your email to us.
