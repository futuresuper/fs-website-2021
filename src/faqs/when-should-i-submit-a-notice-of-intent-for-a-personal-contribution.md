If you intend to claim a tax deduction for any personal super contributions that you’ve made from your after-tax income, you’ll need to submit a [Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions form](https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/n71121-11-2014_js33406_w.pdf) to your super fund before the relevant deadline. 

You need to submit your form by the earlier of either:

* Before the end of the day that you lodge your income tax return for the income year in which the personal contributions were made; OR
* Before the end of the financial year after the financial year in which the contributions were made.

For example, if you made personal contributions in the 2022-2023 financial year, you’re required to submit your Notice of Intent either before you lodge your 2022-2023 tax return, or before the end of the next financial year (30th June 2024), whichever comes sooner.

*Please note that as stated in **Section D: Declaration of the form,** we can only apply a Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions to your account to **a) contributions received by and currently held by Future Super, and b) while you are a current member of Future Super.***


***We are not able to apply your notice to any personal contributions that you made to another fund prior to rolling over to Future Super, or to any contributions made to your account while you were a member if you have exited the Fund before filing your notice of intent to claim.***
