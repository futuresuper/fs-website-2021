Future Super doesn’t have a cash option, but many other funds do. During the market volatility around the start of the pandemic some people did choose to switch to cash. Unfortunately, research found that members in the averaged super balanced option who switched to cash in April 2020 would have lost up to 27% by July 2021.

We do allocate a portion of the portfolio to cash, and in certain situations the investment team could choose to allocate more to cash if it deems that as the most appropriate action.

If you’re considering options for your super, we recommend you seek personal financial advice before making a decision.
