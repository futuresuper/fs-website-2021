If you’d like to grow your super balance, you can make contributions to your super from your after-tax pay - these payments are called [](https://moneysmart.gov.au/grow-your-super/super-contributions) **[non-concessional contributions](https://moneysmart.gov.au/grow-your-super/super-contributions).**

When you make a personal contribution, it's not as simple as putting the dollar amount in your account. Before a payment can be allocated to your account, we need information, via a personal contribution form (please see below for more information) to allocate it correctly. If we do not receive the correct information in time, **your funds may be returned to you.**

Your super is split into [](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/APRA-regulated-funds/Paying-benefits/Calculating-components-of-a-super-benefit/) [components](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/APRA-regulated-funds/Paying-benefits/Calculating-components-of-a-super-benefit/) depending on the source of the funds. As these can affect the way your super is taxed or paid in the future, the ATO requires that we record this information at the time we accept funds into your account.

**How to make a personal contribution to your Future Super account**

There's two steps: 

1. **Fill out the Make a Personal Contribution Form in your online account**. You can find it under *Everything else > Actions > Make a personal contribution.*\
   \
   When you complete this form, you'll have a unique reference number generated for you - we ask that you use this as the transaction reference or description for your payment, so our administrators can match your payment to your account. You can tell us here if you're intending on making a one-off payment, or if you're setting up a recurring payment.\
   \
   If you prefer not to use the online form, or you're having difficulty, you can fill in the paper [Personal and Spouse Contribution Form](https://content.myfuturesuper.com.au/forms-docs/FS_PersonalContributionForm_01072022.pdf) and send it to info@futuresuper.com.au.


2. **Transfer the funds via direct deposit or BPAY.**\
   \
   Set up a payment using direct deposit or BPAY - you can set up a scheduled payment if you’ve noted in your Personal Contribution Form that you’re intending on making recurring contributions. \
   \
   You can find our bank account details when you’re completing the Personal Contribution Form in your online account, or in [Personal and Spouse Contribution Form](https://content.myfuturesuper.com.au/forms-docs/FS_PersonalContributionForm_01072022.pdf).\
   \
   For your **transaction description**, **please enter the unique reference number from your online form.** \
   \
   If you use the manual personal contribution form, you'll need to make sure the payment reference you choose in Section 2 exactly matches the payment description you enter when you make the payment from your bank account. We recommend using your member number + contribution type e.g. 123456personal.




**Annual contribution caps and tax deductions**

The Australian Taxation Office sets an annual contribution cap (per financial year), and if you go over this cap you may be required to pay additional tax - you can [see more information here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?page=1#Contributions_caps). 

For the 2022/2023 financial year,  the  contribution caps are $110,000 for non-concessional contributions (contributions made from after-tax income which you do not claim a tax deduction for), and  $27,500 for concessional contributions (contributions made from pre-tax income which are taxed on entry to the fund) per financial year.

If you wish to claim your personal contributions as a tax deduction, you need to complete a [Notice of intent to claim or vary a deduction for personal super contributions form](https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/n71121-11-2014_js33406_w.pdf). You can do this once per financial year for all the contributions during that financial year.

You can submit the form to us by email to info@futuresuper.com.au. Once your Notice of intent has been applied to your contributions, we’ll generate an acknowledgement letter - this is your receipt of a valid notice for your tax records. You’ll receive an email notification when this has been uploaded to your online account - please allow 2-7 business days for processing.

You can find further instructions about how to make a [claim on the ATO website here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Claiming-deductions-for-personal-super-contributions/?page=2#How_to_make_a_claim), and more information on[ how and when to submit a Notice of intent here](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/when-should-i-submit-a-notice-of-intent-for-a-personal-contribution/).
