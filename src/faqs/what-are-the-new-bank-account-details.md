title: What are the new bank account details?

Our bank account and BPAY details will change on 22nd July 2023.

This means if you make regular **personal contributions** to your account or have saved our details in the past, **you will need to update these on the 22nd of July**.Â 

These details will be available in your [online account](https://my.futuresuper.com.au/#/login) and through the app for any future contributions you wish to make. Please click on "Make a personal contribution" and find the new details at the end of the form. For further instructions on how to make a personal contribution, see our [website](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/how-do-i-make-personal-contributions-to-my-account/)

**This will not impact your employer contributions** as your employer makes payments through a [clearing house](https://www.futuresuper.com.au/faqs/what-is-a-clearing-house/).

Any contributions received using our old details after **21 July 2023** will be returned.\
