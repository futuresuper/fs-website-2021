You should submit a [Notice of Intent form](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms/notice-of-intent-to-claim-or-vary-a-deduction-for-personal-super-contributions/) to Future Super if you have made personal contributions to your Future Super account and ***wish to claim the partial or full amount of these contributions as a tax deduction.***

You can read more about what a personal contribution is on [this ATO page](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/super-for-individuals-and-families/super/growing-and-keeping-track-of-your-super/how-to-save-more-in-your-super/personal-super-contributions).

You can claim a tax deduction for personal contributions made in the current or previous financial year, provided you have not lodged your tax return for that year.
